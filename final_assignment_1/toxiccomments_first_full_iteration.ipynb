Many people think this is the only way true beer should be made.  Nevertheless some people do make beer out of other ingredients.  Now it might be correct to say that 'traditional ale' is made only of these ingredients and it is certainly true that beer made according to the \"\"Bavarian Purity Law\"\" should be made from only these ingredients.  \n",

The saveur.com article, the only source against my claim that I consider at least semi-reliable, says \"\"It can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment\"\". Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. \n",
      "I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.\n",
      "But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled \"\"unfermented\"\", maybe except for Japanses \"\"kimuchi\"\" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.    \n",

The Blue Line has no connections to any other rail lines. I think the Orange Line has a connection at Wellington, and the Green Line has only Riverside. So there MAY very indirect connections between the Red, Orange and Green, but they are never used except in emergencies (like when the Green Line flooded and Commuter Rail trains served Riverside).   \n",

At Cabot Yard (Red Line) and South Bay Yard (Commuter Rail) the two systems are totally separated, lookign at aerials on that same site. So the only one remaining to check is Wellington.   \n",

But at one point the Longfellow Bridge track did connect to other streetcar tracks. And I think I found a connection north of Wellington on aerials at http://www.globexplorer.com/ , but I'm not sure - shouldn't be too hard to spot from the Commuter Rail (harder from the Orange Line because of the unused east track) if it exists.

      "A couple of things to note. AWB can be used as a bot but mostly its used in semi manual mode. Although it does help to greatly increase the speed and efficiency of ones edits it also is just one of many tools, like twinkle, Hotcat and a variety of others whose edits are counted. I would also note that I question the data somewhat because Rich Farmbrough did a lot of edits himself prior to being banned from automation so I find it hard to believe that there was only a modest drop. I doubt that the remaining editors did enough edits to offset that loss and certainly counting bot edits we are missing out on a lot. With that said, the corps Wikipedia site seems to be operating progressively slower with each new release so that IMO is at least part of the reason for the decline. Also, the tabs tend to jump around a lot on slow connections so editors not familiar with the site get turned off rather quickly by have to play chase the wild button around. I have had multiple potential editors tell me that they got fed up when trying to make an edit because the buttons kept jumping and instead of hitting the talk or edit button they hit something else. A variety of other factors also impacts things but I'll leave it there for now.\n",

      " Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.\n",
      " As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that \"\"CITATION NEEDED\"\" was not vandalism, then the next time they used \"\"NEED CITATION\"\", or \"\"CITATION REQUIRED\"\" or \"\"FACT CHECK\"\", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  \"\n",

      "This assumption that German is the largest ancestry in the U.S. shows how the ancestry chart in the article is a little misleading, because most of the 20.2 million people who claim an undifferentiated ‘American’ ancestry are thought to be of English ancestry, in addition to the 24.5 million who actually specify English ancestry. Even if we decide to exclude all the Catholic Irish, most of whom were English-speaking British subjects when they migrated, roughly half of Irish Americans, or about 15 million, are thought to be Protestants, mostly from Ulster, and therefore mostly of mainland British ancestry too. So in fact there are many more Americans of British descent than of German descent, and they still use their language. In addition, German Americans assimilated and only a small proportion of them speak German. Almost all of them speak English instead. This lack of cultural affinity in descendants has had important historical consequences. It helps to explain why German-American relations have been more distant than the ethnic chart would otherwise suggest, and why German ancestry hasn't always been a big enough factor to overcome diplomatic differences.\n",

      "Æµ§œš¹ There is an Afrocentiric view of the world and there is a non Afrocentric view.  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora.  The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics.  The counterfeiters and plagiarizers that have for years attempted to filch the word Ebonics and with the intent to deceive used the word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other such appellations clearly have Hoary confused. [See Smith (1997) and Smith and Crozier (1998)].   In the “About Wikipedia” section on the main page of  Wikipedia we are told the following as the etymological origin or genesis of the word “Wikipedia”:  “Wikipedia (pronounced /ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə/ WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The name \"\"Wikipedia\"\" is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning \"\"quick\"\") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.”  Now, just as the word Ebonics is a is portmanteau of the words ‘ebony’ and ‘phonics’ the word or name Wikipedia is portmanteau of the words ‘wiki’ and ‘encyclopedia’.  According to the ‘About Wikikpedia’ section the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is from the Hawaiian word ‘wiki’ meaning ‘quick’ not the word ‘wickyapi’ an Algonquian Indian language from which the word ‘wickiup’ is derived.  Thus the word Wikipedia is not derived from the Algonquian Indian word ‘wikiyapi’ and it origin has nothing to do with the word’wickiup’ that means “a hut used by nomadic Indians of the arid regions of the western and southwestern U.S.” (see Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2001:1347)  As defined by its author the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is not a portmanteau of the word ‘wicked’ and ‘pedophile’ and it has noting to do with “wicked pedophiles”.  User Hoary thinks it is allright to encompass meanings for the word ‘Wikipedia’ that the founders of ‘Wikipdeia’ never intended and defend the use of any and all counterfeit meanings on the web all over the world. \n",
      "I accept what is presented in quotes above as being the origin and true meaning of the name “Wikipedia”.   I believe the meaning posited for Wikipedia above is the only authenthic meaning of word ‘Wikipedia’.   I wonder how the author(s) originator(s) of the name ‘Wikipedia’ would feel if there were counterfeiters and plagiarizers going all over the world misrepresenting and outright mis-using the name “Wikipedia”?\n",

      "Purrum, get the story accurate rather than make more false allegations about Opas. You are trying to confuse the \"\"facts\"\", as per usual. Truth is, Opas wrote many articles, which have always clearly stated the \"\"facts\"\" - that only one single shot was heard by all persons and prison officer Paterson testified he fired one single shot. Also, prison officer Pascoe admitted on national television in 1986 (19 years after Ryan was hanged) that he fired a shot from tower 3, which might have killed Hodson. Pascoe stated that he was a young scared coward at the time for keeping quiet as he didn't want to get into trouble and lose his job. Hence, there has been much speculation over the decades of where the fatal shot was fired from, and by whom. The \"\"fact\"\" remains that the police and prosecution failed, for whatever reason, to provide a shred of scientific forensic evidence, which would have proven beyond reasonable doubt who's rifle fired the fatal shot. Nobody's rifle was ever tested. There were lots of prison officers with lots of rifles at the time everyone heard one single shot. Not one single rifle, including Ryan's rifle, was tested for evidence. This is a \"\"fact\"\". Purrum should stick to the \"\"facts\"\" rather than contribute opinions, views, allegations without substance.   07:52\"\n",

I'd be happy to send you a scan of it. At the top it says, \"\"This agreement made this 13th Day of June, 1932, between RKO Studios and Peg Entwistle.\"\" It is signed by Entwistle, David O. Selznick, and Daniel L. Oshea, Selnick's Assistant Secretary. Then you added that Entwistle played in bit parts in several films (I'm paraphrasing), and referenced a source. But this claim of bit parts in other films proved to be untrue when I researched the entire body of RKO's inter-office memos at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences archives in the Herrick Library in Beverly Hills. (I have copies of all the Selznick and Cukor memos regarding \"\"Thirteen Women,\"\" and other possible Peg Entwistle-related projects (such as discussions regarding Billie Burke wanting Peg instead of Katherine Hepburn in \"\"Bill of Divorcement.\"\" (Would you like to see them, too?)\n",

I found Entwistle doing radio in 1925, having lunch at the White House in 1931, being black mailed, and a dozen other things no onenot even her family had known.

Records in the genre are unabashed about their use of electronic and artificial sounds, taking this technological fetish almost into science fiction with many records about space travel and futuristic dystopias. Timing range is 118 to 135 beats per minute(BPM). Electro is a derivitive of the '[Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, Roland VP-330 Vocoder]' Drum machines & Vocoder's Speech Synthesizer.

      "Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]\n",
      "I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10\n",

      "The outcome of an experiment need not be a number, for example, the outcome when a coin is tossed can be 'heads' or 'tails'. However, we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. A random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.\n",

      "\n",
      "The term \"\"macroevolution\"\" frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within animal kinds, which change is referred to as \"\"microevolution\"\", but deny that one animal kind can evolve into another, which change is called \"\"macroevolution\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The terms macroevolution and microevolution as used in mainstream science relate to the same processes operating at different scales, but creationist claims misuse the terms in a vaguely defined way which does not accurately reflect scientific usage, acknowledging well observed evolution as \"\"microevolution\"\" and denying that \"\"macroevolution\"\" takes place.CB902: Microevolution is distinct from macroevolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Darwinists Nicholas Matzke and Paul R. Gross have accused creationists of using \"\"strategically elastic\"\" definitions of micro- and macroevolution when discussing the topic. The actual definition of macroevolution accepted by scientists is \"\"any change at the species level or above\"\" (phyla, group, etc.) and microevolution is \"\"any change below the level of species.\"\" Matzke and Gross state that many creationist critics define macroevolution as something that cannot be attained, as these critics describe any observed evolutionary change as \"\"just microevolution\"\".\n",

      "And what do \"\"quanta\"\" and \"\"cosmology\"\" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as \"\"the study of everything\"\" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain \"\"bulk\"\" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.\"\n",

      "On the two narratives of the Creation Story (Gen. 1:1-2:4a and 2:4b-25), please notice the following inconsistencies:\n",
      "a. In the first narrative, man was created on the sixth day where man the last of God's creation. On the second narrative, notice that man was first to be created.\n",
      "b. In the first narrative, all other creatures (birds, fishes, animals, plants, etc.) created before the creation of man where man created at the same time; both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative, note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures. When none proved to be the suitable partner for man, it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created.\n",
      "c. In the second narrative, the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I (\"\"I will make a suitable partner for man\"\") while in the first narrative, when GOD created man, GOD said \"\"Let US create man...\"\"\n",
      "d. Note that in the first narrative, God created all things using His word (Let there be...) while in the second narrative, Lord God created all creatures including man \"\"out of the (clay of the) ground\"\".\n",
      "e. In the first narrative, everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase \"\"God saw (his creation) that it was good\"\" while on the second narrative, the Lord God said \"\"IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone\"\" considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone. Believe it or not, it is was a mistake. It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely, Eve could not have been created. Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals. Upon notice of man's loneliness, God created different animals (2:19)and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner. Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals. Hence the question again, does God know what he was doing? It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR. And true enough, EVE is a product of ERROR.\n",
      "e. Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative. Gen 2 (the second story of creation) is therefore the original creation story. But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative. Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament. Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis. \n",

Question is; when did God created the SUN? Was it on the first or the fourth day. If it's the latter, what light did He create on the first day?\n",
      "b. It is not correct to call the garden Eden. The correct text states (2:8) \"\"LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden\"\". Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself. The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being \"\"East of Eden\"\".\n",
      "c. Note that in the 2:5, it was stated \"\"the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth\"\". Question: when was rain created?\n",
      "d. Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim. SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men?\"\" Huhhh?\n",
      "e. It seems disenchanting to consider God a SUPREME ALL POWERFUL BEING but possesses the human frailty of REGRET; (6:6) And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.\n",

When I was very young, people were looking for the \"\"old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes.\"\" I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, \"\"You need peace.\"\" When people said, \"\"Tell us of the scriptures,\"\" I said, \"\"Look within you.\"\" When people asked, \"\"What is your qualification?\"\" I said, \"\"Judge me by what I offer.\"\" To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same. In that same article Rawat states that people wanted to see him as a figurehead and as a leader but that he does not want to be one or the other, and that all he wanted to do is speak to those who wanted to hear him, and impart the Knowledge to those that sought it. He also said that if people like what is given, to practice it and if not, to leave it.[14]\n",

There is an article wizard which can walk you through the steps. You say he is an \"\"up and coming actor\"\". Well I don't know if there are sufficient sources to support an encyclopedia article, but this statement makes me wary. Please see Wikipedia:Up and coming next big thing.

Once the airfoil is well inside this body of air (by several chord lengths, say 5 or more), the rate of vertical momentum change of this body of air is equal to the lift.

      "\n",
      "Let's leave that to one side however, we could always come back to it later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crux of my point, leaving aside the bias issue, is three-fold. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that \"\"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions\"\". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as \"\"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines\"\". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows \"\"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions\"\". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that \"\"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions\"\". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads \"\"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy\"\". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of \"\"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems...\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to \"\"making claims\"\" or worse, \"\"stating beliefs\"\". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.\n",

Per WP:NOTABLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article. Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider \"\"bad\"\" (which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of \"\"bad science\"\") does not mean that it is \"\"biased\"\" to have an article on them. WP:NPOV does not say that articles can't be about \"\"bad things\"\". It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things, regardless of our moral/ethical views on them. This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts, and histories of this topic have to say about it. I am not aware of anywhere in the article where it is not neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying. \n",

      "No, being an \"\"American film critic\"\" is her defining characteristic, at least in terms of an encyclopedic entry.  If she had repeatedly proclaimed her Jewishness in her reviews, and had become famous as being a \"\"Jewish American film critic\"\", then that would be important to note in the opening paragraph.  My point about the other critics was not that they are Jewish, but that whether or not they are Christian, Jewish, or otherwise is not even mentioned in the lead paragraphs of their articles.  Why should the Kael entry be any different?  Again, it is already mentioned in the article that her parents were Jewish, so its not like I'm attempting to keep something important from \"\"public display\"\".- \n",
      "\n",
      "Of what relevance, is it then, that she is an \"\"American film critic\"\"? Since she doesn't deal only with American filims. This refers to her being an American. Why is that there? The plain and simple fact is that she is a Jew, religiously and ethnically. If it is so important that she not be labelled as such then we can just leave it out but let's make your rationale quite clear. -  \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the relevance of Kael being described as an \"\"American film critic\"\" is because that is exactly why she is/was famous.  It is standard to discuss somebody's nationality in the lead paragraph of an encyclopedic entry, not their religious beliefs unless that was one of the defining characteristics of their fame.  And Kael was NOT famous for being a Jew, she was famous for being a film critic.  If she was a practicing Jew (and I have no idea if she was or not), she never discussed it in print (as far as I can recall) or in any interviews, and it didn't seem to be reflected in her critical POV.  Now, if she had repeatedly brought up her ethnicity/religion in her reviews as some kind of critical barometer, I could easily understand why somebody would feel compelled to describe Kael as a \"\"Jewish film critic\"\".  But she didn't do that.  And again I direct your attention to any of the other film critic articles on wikipedia.  Is Roger Ebert a \"\"Christian film critic\"\"?  Andrew Sarris an \"\"atheist film critic\"\"?  Not according to wikipedia they're not.  (I'm using those two as examples...I don't know or care what, if any, religious background they may have).  And as I've previously pointed out, it  is already noted in the \"\"Biography\"\" section of the article that her parents were Jewish.  Removing this from the lead paragraph will not be \"\"leaving it out\"\" of the article at all.- \"\n",

It's merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article, and a healthy cynicism about some readers' intransigence. One reader has left a very rude & domineering comment on my user page. If personal attacks like that are the norm, I can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article, and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page.

      "As far as I know ancient Summerian and Babylonian writings conjecture that life might exist off Earth and indeed that aliens may have visted our planet. Seperating practical theorizing from mythologizing is of course difficult with ancient works. Anyhow, this places the idea of extraterrestrial life 3000 to 4000 yrs before the present day. Whether there were earlier theories I don't know. In other places where atronomy was independently invented (India, China etc.) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen. Note that the five inner planets (excluding Earth) would all have appeared very unique to any society capable of looking at the stars systematically and would long have appeared good candidates for life.\n",

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is likewise a think tank and reliquary for Israeli right-wingers (retired military and diplomatic staff especially) and funded by convicted felon Michael Milken.

This creates a tone that is completely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article.  Also, there are numerous spelling and grammar errors as well.  Because of this I have restored the older, better version of the article.    \"\n",

I did enjoy reading the article, it  definietly had a lot of information that could be incorporated into the article (if there is another source backing it up). I have two major concerns. Firstly, the article concentrates on the Bosnian side Vlah's and not the Croatian side (the article is Serbs of Croatia not Serbs of Bosnia). Secondly, the article concludes with \"\"...when one hears... Russian politicians talking about the need to defend their ancient Slav brothers in Bosnia, that the one component of the Bosnian population which has a large and identifiable element of non-Slav ancestry is the Bosnian Serbs.\"\" I do not know how accurate the article is because of the last statement (in my opinion it leans towards the Muslim side). Also, inside the article there is a mention that Serbian scholars identify the term Vlah with shepards. Irrespectively, I think the article link was a great contribution.\n",

      " However, I find this discussion interesting as (according to my personal experience) Stockholm with its 'isolated' location in the middle of Sweden rarely relates itself to Denmark or Copenhagen (we don't hear more from Denmark than do people in, say, London, Paris, or Berlin).  In contrast, Danes (always near Sweden) tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour.  Of historical reasons, Finns tend to behave similarly (regarding Sweden).  It might be interesting for the article (maybe the culture section?) to explain this - after all, Stockholm's only official raison d'être is to be the capital of Sweden, but, locally, there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this.  For example, Stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history (sv:Stockholmiana) and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city, notwithstanding most façades (with their beige plaster) are in fact much younger than buildings in an average European city.  Its symptomatic the new Moderna Museet was well-received in Stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in Copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention (i.e. Arken).\n",

Personally I find categories like Category:1963 elections in Europe useful, as you can see several elections at once, and taking articles out of them makes it more difficult to see what's there.

(b) or (c) seem to be reasonable, popular choices. This is something that people are just going to have to think hard about and come to a consensus.

Under (c), but probably not (b), the replacement from the notes that I suggested, the quote from Meltzer -\"\"In fact, ever since the attainment of independence, the universities in Poland had been strongholds of Endejca supporters and centers for anti-semitic agitation.” would be acceptable.

Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others. It wasn't actually me that deleted it, I merely flagged it up as being non-encyclopedic and another editor thought the same. Westenders is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as Uncyclopedia, which is as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go. However, if you do wish to contribute seriously, please don't let this setback stop you - perhaps our paths will cross again in a positive context.   \n",

      "Glad to read you will be trying some editing methods different than what you've been doing up to now. I've been a Wikipedia contributor since early January 2005. I'm not an administrator. There's plenty I don't know…including how it can possibly be that despite a giant chorus of editors and admins telling you you are violating WP:OWN, you continue to insist there's no ownership issue, and that you're right and everyone else is wrong. You seem to feel that the AN/I case was opened to harrass you. In fact, it was opened to prevent much worse consequences (such as your being banned from editing Chevrolet Vega, or from editing at all) down the line. I tried — as did many others — to help you understand the problem. You flatly refuse to do so, and for that reason I have great difficulty taking this present friendly chat of yours at face value. You've got an awful track record to rectify, and as of just a few hours ago you were still building that bad track record. Perhaps that's just face-saving bluster, and your behaviour really is going to change quickly and substantially. I hope so, because you obviously have a great deal to bring to the project. But your long record of crummy behaviour makes that hope extremely thin. Please prove me wrong. — T·C\"\n",

Even if the remaining 43% had all voted for one party, the Liberals would have likely won anyways.  I personally went through the article and added all the vote totals for the NDP and Green candidates. (exlcuding the richmond and delta ridings because there was no totals)   I could only find 7 cases where, had ALL the voters for the Greens AND ndp voted for the same party, they would have defeated the Liberals.   If this had been the case the Liberals STILL would have had 65 of 72 (the legilature minus richmond and delta) seats versus only 9 for the NDP.

Using the constellations to know when to gather eggs, for instance, is a far cry from a Western astrologer consulting an individual's nativity to see when s/he will get married.

When I removed CE, it was for the year 1821 and as we both know from the now familiar WP:ERA, 1821 is not meant to have either CE or AD, especially in the context of the Europa Universalis IV article, since it's already obvious that it's the 1821 from 2 centuries ago.

What you are stating here, however, is nonsense again. The classical forerunner of SRT has been  optics of moving bodies, a discipline dealing with the observation of  point source from a moving platform, which is governed by Bradley's law of velocity aberration. A point source emits spherical waves, not plane waves.\n",

Jackson's book on clsssical electrodynamics as well as in a German book on SRT by Greiner/Rafelski who probably have copied the 'deduction' offered in Jackson's book (who himself probably got that 'deduction' from somewhere else). These 'deductions' boil down to direct betrayal of naive students, because the students are made to believe that a point source, such as a fixed star, does emit plane waves rather than spherical waves. Nobody tells them that the plane wave approximation is only an approximation and that it is, therefore, completely useless to 'prove' something ia a context of paramount importance. \n",

By 1905, Levavasseur had produced a water-cooled engine with eight-cylinders arranged in a 90-degree \"\"V\"\" and with direct fuel injection. It was safe, strong, and fairly powerful, generating 50 horsepower (37 kilowatts) and weighing about 110 pounds (50 kilograms). Its power-to-weight ratio was not surpassed for 25 years\n",

The motor was of advanced design, utilizing direct fuel injection and evaporative steam cooling - which took place in long tubes fixed along the sides of the fuselage. \n",

      "When I see what is going on and I just sit here looking at my content getting stolen by user AI009. Ya I think it is corrupted to see I am bringing up facts and this ass^%#@% goes and steals it away. We do have a problem, glad you brought this up because I feel the heat is on by trying to edit something and trying to bring up valid information where we have this AI009 going on some hate spree on people. I never seen such a crybaby, I would kick the f%^$# out of this guy if I met him in person as he just tells on people. Ya the discussion and Superpowers articles are indeed a big bunch of lying facts, really just one big sad story by a hate parade. I suggest the wikipedia people take the whole thing out, write a topic on the Superpowers and Potential superpowers homepages saying the site is down due to wikipedia hate crimes or something to tell people that the information is not useful information by being corrupt for reading. I would like to see that because we have just too much fighting. Saruman20, yes a Superpower is an important view but the internet is not a mandatory subject or place; people shouldn't just rely on Wikipedia to read about a Superpower or Potential Superpowers, there are books and books out there I think many people should read instead of relying on a community of people we have no idea on their qualifications (these could be truck drivers or a janitor or a university professor, a waitress, a banker or whatever, no one knows anybody so that does not make it creditable but a book, says something about the write and their reference information, Wikipedia is like Myspace or homepage blog), even AI009 hasn't even read a single page to say the things that are being said. We have too much people crying the blues editing and some are just using every chain of command to protect themselves by nurking on people for silly stupids things, creating a bunch of crap, which just starts wars on each other. I couldn't say one person accept for AI009 who uses every possibility to burn the fire than putting it out. Rocks and stones are allover the place, so trying to fix the mess is not the right answer, so there should be an elimination, not a meditation or a discussion to fix but to discontinue it.\n",

We correlate a Wikipedia-derived gender inequality indicator (WIGI), with four widespread gender inequality indices in use today (GDI, GEI, GGGI, and SIGI). Analysing their methodologies and correlations to Wikipedia, we find evidence that Wikipedia's bias in biographical coverage is related to the gender bias in positions of social power.\n",

The National Retrieved from http://ezproxy.sfpl.org/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1515588882?accountid=35117 Prof Bruckner's hope is that having systemic data on the extent and reasons behind bias could mobilise resources to deal with the issue. It might help, she suggests, if universities encouraged staff to become Wikipedia contributors, ensuring important academic work does not get ignored. They could, for example, expand the programmes some of them already run for academics on writing newspaper editorial columns - another area where female writers tend to be heavily outnumbered - to cover Wikipedia contributions. \"\"That is not something we usually do. We're scientists, we're not in the business of marketing our research. We have no training to do this,\"\" said Prof Bruckner. She admits she has never contributed to Wikipedia herself. The apparent bias could also be partly redressed by focusing on general initiatives to improve Wikipedia's quality. For Prof Bruckner, the Wikipedia project may also offer pointers about how the value of academic work in general is assessed. \"\"There is the gender issue, but also how people think about scholarship and what's reputable scholarship or not,\"\" she said.\"\n",

There seems to be some misunderstandings here and there in the project, with claims that \"\"German has preserved the proto-germanic grammar\"\" or similarly.  This is not 100% true (although German certainly has preserved much of the grammar).  I therefore think that mentioning the instrumental case, and the fact that there were more different endings in OHG than in modern High German is interesting enough to merit a section.  I do not think we should try to reproduce all paradigms; but some representative sample.

You're starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made \"\"American\"\" an understood term for \"\"from the United States\"\" in most countries \"\"American\"\" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term \"\"Americano\"\" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you've implied \"\"America\"\" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn't mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don't share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you're trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn't count) then \"\"rest-of-the-world\"\" views are perfectly acceptable. This page exists, in part, to make it clear that \"\"American\"\" is not always a demonym of the USA and this is a fact. As much a fact as U.S. citizens believen it does.\n",

      "\"\"Äpotropaic\"\" means \"\"to turn away\"\": the idea was that a demon could be turned away from a house etc by displaying a holy text (or at least a magical text) near the door. The inscription therefore had to be clearly visible - at head-level, and outside the door (no point in letting your demon come inside before he could read the magic). The Tel Yayit stone doesn't fulfill these criteria: it was being used in an internal wall, inside a dark room, was about 3 feet off the ground, and was very faint. The archaeologists who found it missed it themselves until the last day of excavation, when they just happened to see it early one morning in ideal conditions, in the low raking light of the rising sun. Tho the setting sun would have done just as well. But the point is, in a dark room 3 feet off the ground, no demon is going to see it or read it, and even if he were a midget-demon, he's already inside, so what's the point? So, no apotropaic powers for this stone.  \"\n",

      "Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines:\n",
      "Stores aren't products, so I would suggest you not list stores such as \"\"Herman's Military Antiques\"\".\n",
      "Bulk groups of products like the \"\"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques\"\".\n",
      "Do not include real-world products like \"\"English Muffins\"\". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise.\n",
      "The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control:\n",
      "Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added \"\"Radioactive Man Comics\"\", \"\"The Springfield Shopper\"\" and \"\"Li'l Bastard Kits\"\". These are great ones, but things like \"\"Disemboweller IV\"\" needn't be included.\n",

      "\"\"No one realized that lives had been lost until later that night, when firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies, thought at first to be mannequins.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not true. This was reported in our local papers as well. The night of the fire, the media were told almost nothing, and had to go by rumor. I spoke to the fire chief, as well as numerous others on the scene that night. You see, except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers, where the walls were not made of plywood, everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash. The bodies were discovered before dark, as soon as the fire was extinguished, not much later in the night.\n",
      "The firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains: bones, blood, jewelry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile. (I've seen the photos) Additionally, the stench of burned flesh was overpowering, being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit, separated only by a chain link fence from the Haunted Castle trailers. Wax mannequins would have been long-since melted. \n",
      "The truth is that the management at first claimed (and might have believed) to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the HC, and there was no reason to close the park. The  castle was isolated, so the fire couldn't spread to other buildings. The fire was out by 7:45, and the park closed at 8:00 p.m. I've never heard of SFGA kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night, with fair weather with a free return pass. An unprecedented decision was made and implemented in 15 minutes. Given this time frame, they clearly found the bodies instantly, and there wasn't time to think that they were \"\"mannequins\"\".    \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Eight days after the fire, a statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said a 13-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a 14-year-old boy at the castle's entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.\"\"\n",
      "Police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning, and interviewed both Saturday May 12th.  The younger boy's parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast. The older boy was turned in by his teacher, who had seen him unattended, exit a burning Haunted Castle, and alerted police as soon as he could. This boy set numerous fires. Bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it. Try to reproduce such a thing. It takes about 30 seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam. It is unclear why the prosecutor didn't go after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under cross-examination by the defense, the witness denied starting the fire himself.\"\"\n",

Appalachian State definitely deserves mentioning, but Colorado and Michigan State, while both having great and interesting finishes, are not important enough to be mentioned in the header, particularly when you combine it with the absence of the 1945 Army game, and the 1969 and 2006 Ohio State-Michigan games, the '69 game in particular because Woody admitted that was his best team and the Wolverines cost the Buckeyes what would have surely been a national title since the Buckeyes were locked out of the Rose Bowl. If Colorado and Michigan State are worth mentioning, then so is 2010 Illinois and 2011 Notre Dame. Interesting, great games, but probably not worthy of being put in the header. Speaking of which, those games should be incorporated into the history section. That may be done by the time you read this.\n",

It is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name. A few points. Moving from Toronto to B.C was for one sole reason and that was to find work. There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001.

I am a lawyer qualified in one jurisdiction, and pursuing qualification in another jurisdiction. In any event, this page only deals with Personal Jurisdiction, I did not think it appropriate to talk about other things. And, I thought that what I was adding would most obviously be related only to personal jurisdiction. If a sentence says \"\"apples, oranges etc\"\" you cant interpret pens and pencils as the \"\"etc\"\", its obviously only restricted to fruits. When I say that the head of state has no power to act outside his kingdom in an article titled \"\"personal jurisdiction\"\" it most certainly cannot be construed that he cant do ANYTHING in that other state, what is said has to be read in light of the subject being spoken of. Otherwise you can have absolutely ridiculous interpretations of what I have said. By that sense, any and every action of the head of state outside the territory would be illegal, thats insane. I dont think you are really objecting to what I am saying, I think this is more of a turf war, and you seem to have a problem with the fact that I have added something and you did not. If thats the case, I dont really care, this is something I am doing for spreading knowledge not for any personal gain, you may go ahead and abuse your power as an editor and deface the page. I shall however reiterate that if you have any objection with anything in particular you can tell me what exactly you want a cite for, ill try my best to get the cite.

      "I think that one of the confounding issues is what to name what Einstein called \"\"spooky action at a distance.\"\" The idea of action involves the application of some force over some amount of time, and our ordinary idea of \"\"causing something\"\" involves exerting force on some system to influence its behavior. But entanglement is exhibited without the lag that would be required were interactions at a velocity ≤ c, so something is going on that is not \"\"causal\"\" in the usual sense. On the other hand, before one or the other entangled twin particles is measured, they both have the freedom or the potential to manifest either spin, and after one of them is measured and must manifest a spin then the other no longer has the freedom or potential to manifest any spin other than the opposite of the one that was first measured. So something has changed, and it strikes me as creating an intellectual smokescreen to say that there is only some kind of abstract \"\"correlation\"\" involved. Like the \"\"collapse\"\" of a wavefunction, we have no idea of what is going on or how to describe it. All we know is that it happens. It also strikes me as possibly significant that the time sequence may not be clear. From my frame of reference, electron A is observed first, and electron B is observed second. Someone else, in another frame of reference, may see electron B as being observed first and electron A as being observed second. There are also phenomena within the same frame of reference that we call retrocausal. We have no way of knowing that the discovery of the polarity of photon B at time T+n determines, retrocausally, the polarity of photon A at time T. If we say that these changes are not local, that must  (I think) mean that they are not local in space-time. So, in a sense, I end up arguing against my own discomfort with the idea that there is \"\"only\"\" a correlation between the discovered states of any entangled twins. \n",

The film had me yawning all the way through and I genuinely had to check myself several times from shutting off for a kip! Never a bright moment, nothing to lift the mood, even the silly cameos in it. It's not that the film, the scenery or whatever is bog standard or dreadful, but its the way the scene are compiled and the lifelessness of the actors in it which make it exceedingly dull and uninspiring to watch. David Lean was apparently an uncredited assistant director on it which I find hard to believe. Uncredited perhaps because of sheer embarrassment with the result. I'm not sure how anything in which Lean so much as touched ended up that dull... I just saw Treasure Island (1972 film). Welles was perfect casting as Long John!

      "I was wondering if you knew much about the Microsoft WGA program. I know there are a lot of people who think this program is spyware. My understanding was that it could be classified under this category because of how Microsoft destributes it as a critical security update on Windows Update. Not to mention the stories I have heard about the tool phoning home to Microsoft on a regular basis. One other strange thing that I have been hearing from my friend about is people going and validating their PC on the Microsoft Download Center to access a downolad. After the download is complete they run an antispyware program and find that the WGA validation tool has caused a Browser Hijack attempt. I do not know if these stories would be good material for the WGA article here on Wikipedia. I am still searching the web to see if I can find evidence to back some of this up. I was also wondering if you had heard any of these strange stories yourself. Please respond on my talk page and tell me what you think.\n",

      "I'm not the \"\"paid editor\"\" to which you referred, but I am gravely concerned by the proposal for a change to the terms of use that describes edits as \"\"deception\"\" and allows anyone to make such accusations against any editor at any time. It is impossible for editors to prove they are *not* receiving some form of benefit. The examples of \"\"benefit\"\" (which the WMF has tried to obfuscate now that some people have noticed the expansiveness of the proposal) includes things like receiving a t-shirt or a meal (any \"\"money, goods or services\"\"). Unfortunately, there's a great deal of handwaving about paid editing, but very little evidence that there's any greater bias in edits that are paid for than edits that are not.  A large number of the articles created in the latest paid editing \"\"scandal\"\" are still present, and many that were deleted still easily met our notability standards. There is not a good faith editor who hasn't received some sort of benefit or reward from their work on Wikipedia. Nobody has yet demonstrated that people who are paid do any worse at editing Wikipedia than people who aren't paid.  Meanwhile, there's lots of evidence that people who want to push a point of view will not hesitate to accuse editors of being paid or otherwise having a serious conflict of interest (q.v., the Arbcom archives). The proposal is one more tool in the arsenal for people who are motivated to go after their opponents, and does absolutely nothing at all to improve the project.    \"\n",

Granted, Newman would have to have found new physics to make his machine work, but I assume we are discussing textbook physics and EE in this side note. Specifically:\n",
      " It's not the resistive (heat) losses (or other losses) which bound the electric motor's efficency to 100%. Even using a supraconducting coil and everything you wish, you won't get above 100%  the counter voltage induced by the rotation will make the input power needed to sustain rotation equal to mechanical work done.\n",

      " But I agree with your guess that the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy. Every time some energy is transported away from a system, the system loses mass according to E=mc²  in most cases an unmeasurable low amount. Also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies, you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance, exactly that amount of mass will be lost (If we keep the system isolated, its total mass stays the same, e.g when letting the two bodys clonking together, the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy, then to heat, and both contribute to the mass of the system, which in effect stays constant). But in a motor the movement is periodic, so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of transmutate into something other than normal copper.\n",

This nihilism which you honour lacks any intellectual basis. It basically lies on the assumption that since 'moral habits' change over time and vary from place to place, we can have no moral base, and thus, anything goes.

For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage.

In fact references to the actual vinyl releases for most statements on this page hold more merit than books or articles. Why? Articles written on Trance are highly suspect and not scholarly sources. Even if they were written from some 'reputable source', half the time it is written by some nerd who has it completely wrong, or interviewed by some DJ who has an adgenda to 'attach himself' as some creator.

Even though there appears shrines and a tree with a shimenawa, it doesn't mean that Totoro has shintoist themes because you can see shinto shrine everywhere in Japan. Regarding appearance of shrine as Shintoism is just a misunderstanding by foreigners who have little knowledge of the Japanese way of religion. Obake has nothing to do with shinto either. No Japanese people regard obake as a part of shinto. If you call Totoro religious, almost all Japanese anime and manga will be religious. Do you call Inuyasha religious just because Kagome lives in a shrine? Or do you call Yu Yu Hakusho religious because Yusuke became a ghost and there're many yokais in the show? Or do you say Shrek has Christian themes just because there's a church? Calling something shintoism just because it is traditional is nonsense. Even if Totoro seems to have shintoist themes to the westerners' eyes, it just means Totoro is a movie set in the Japanese countryside and it is nothing worthy of special mention.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You may believe most Japanese people are shintoist, but it is not necessarily true. They go to shrine on New Year's Day not because they believe in shinto but simply beacuse it is Japanese tradition. The same thing can be said about the appearance of the shrine in Totoro. The appearance of shinto shrine or that of obake cannot be connected to shinto. Believe it or not, it is true that there's no Japanese word for \"\"shintoist\"\" although there is the word for \"\"Buddhist\"\", bukkyouto. In other words, Japanese people don't regard them something like \"\"shintoist\"\". To Japanese, shinto is not something you believe in or you don't blieve in. There's no bible or dogma. Shinto is nothing like Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. It is even doubtful whether it is proper to say that shinto is a religion. \n",
      "Totoro is nothing religious. Repeat, the appearance of the shrine doesn't mean Totoro has shintoist themes. I must say that to see Totoro religious is only a biased viewpoint.

Rather, I imagine he was trying to evoke images of a lost past (as it is set in the 1950s) when things were simpler, and trying to get people to remember their roots and not forget their traditions. As you wrote yourself, Shinto is not so much a religion anymore (except to a very few), but more of a set of traditions with some religious elements. Totoro can have Shinto elements without being a religious film. I don't think anyone is arguing the film is religious. You're the only one who's said anything about that. I do find it odd how you reply to yourself above, and appear to be arguing with yourself.···? · Talk to Nihonjoe \n",

The \"\"Kekule notation\"\" seems to be much more popular among chemists. It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and \"\"electron pushing\"\" much more straightforward. The circle notation only seems to be common for some organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and some aromatic ions such as the cyclopentadienyl anion and the tropylium cation.   \"\n",

It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

      "Please reverse this merger. The simplest and most important reason is that aside from it's function as a thyroid hormone thyroxine is simply a chemical compound that should have its own article. For instance, go look at the triiodothyronine page and you'll see the standard chemical description page there with molecular weight, chemical formula, IUPAC name, etc. - a wealth of information uninteresting to and therefore absent from the thyroid hormone page this link now redirects to. The original thyroxine page should be restored with all of this chemical information. Regarding some of the above discussion - it is true that thyroxine produced in the thyroid can be either enantiomer and that the isolated levo-thyroxine enantiomer is what is in the drug. This is specifically interesting because levothyroxine can only be converted to \"\"normal\"\" T3, not \"\"reverse\"\" T3 - which is the other enantiomer. This has physiological consequences for those on the drug. So I think this is good information that we should add to the Thyroxine page once it is restored - but I don't think a separate page is needed for that. We just need the separate Thyroxine page back to have a place for that information to go - along with all of the now absent chemical information since merger with the Thyroid Hormones article.

      " Binky, grow up. All you want is to be obstructive and destructive of real info included on WP - you're solidly outed. You might as well admit it. At least to yourself. Over here you write: \"\"You know, I like your Strauss-Kahn addition, using good sourcing, but this bit about bootlegs is your weak area. You need to find a source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\": that being so, why don't you do it yourself, and thus help additions those less skillful at manipulating WP than you, try to contribute? Instead of actively deleting and obstructing the info being included, under increasingly fanciful pretexts (incidentally, \"\"source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\" is easily found on Youtube and elsewhere, e.g. http://www.freetimeweb.nl/home/muziek/ccr/johnfogerty_bootleg.html (I'm sure even you can google \"\"Fogerty bootleg\"\", though actually I didn't add that info - I only supplied the ref, before you deleted it all). But you deleted it or had it deleted, instead of supporting it with adjustments, as you could've done, improving instead of obstructing - how's that for an idea?). You appear to be an amateur psychopat, taking out your failed real life on innocents on WP. You a-soul. Be a good person. Instead of being destructive and obstructive, be constructive. If you know how - if not, try to learn. Even a miserable psychopat like you can turn around. Try. - Plus, incidentally, I haven't been edit-warring but reverting your edit-warring and vandalism (check history if you suddenly don't recall - but your memory is tendentially selective, I'm sure, recalling only that which supports your lies, right?). I'm no expert at WP and have no time to become one - I only wanted to contribute, not to get embroiled with an apparent psychopat like you. Plus re new IPs: if frequent power-outages happen to change my IP, don't flatter yourself that it's in response to your unacceptable behaviour: you're not on par with hurricane Nina. At all. You're merely a small gust temporarily confusing, but achieving nothing - except making people tire of you. You really are a tiresome fogey, as demonstrated when you write and admit: \"\"despite the truth of what you were inserting\"\". Well, that truth being so, why don't you help fix it, instead of hounding away the contributor? But you apparently don't think facts should have primacy on WP, rather your quarrelling should, right? - I'm no expert on the rules you misuse, and won't waste time to become one - as I have a real life. I merely contribute where I can, as an attitude to life. Try it. You might like it. Actually -). Instead of perfecting being an apparent grumpy old man and failed psychopat, scouring WP for victims. You won, because I'm not interested in your fight. Now you've successfully excluded good info from WP, info which even you concede is \"\"the truth\"\". That's a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one. Hope this little letter changes you for the better, because that's truly needed. Try it: Help info get on to WP, instead of picking quarrels by deleting what even you call \"\"the truth\"\". Focus on getting correct info on to WP, instead of getting lost in \"\"the system\"\". - That's just an idea, but think it over. It might do you good. Get well soon. Bye now.

However, it also would eliminate a great many true credentials claims, and the underlying premise of the proposal is that true claims are beneficial. You may disagree with that premise, but that's a different discussion. I would like to find a way to verify pseudonymous claims, while still generally preserving privacy. I do think that's possible within reason, although probably not in an absolutely fraud-proof way. As you point out in your opening contribution, the verifiers must be trusted since not just anyone could recheck (otherwise it wouldn't be preserve privacy).

      " Shrug. You can say that for any kingdom. The Germanic concept of a \"\"kingdom\"\" is not a geographic area, it is a political area, defined by folks, not acres.  The area (often a Latin term) will always be an informal shorthand for a collection of dominions of barons owing allegiance to a king. \"\"East Franks\"\" are a folk, \"\"Germany\"\" is an area. \"\"Lombards\"\" are a folk. \"\"Italy\"\" is an area, etc. The \"\"Kingdom of Germany\"\" refers to the collection of barons in the area that once constituted the lands of the East Franks and their subject tribes (Swabians, Bavarians, Saxons, Thuringians, etc.), which by the 10th-11th C. is now settled down into large duchies (the royal duchy of Franconia, plus Swabia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc.).  This specific collection of barons acclaim their king, who is crowned in Aachen (usually) by the Archbishop of Mainz (almost always).  This is the \"\"King of Germany\"\", and the area these barons cover we can call the \"\"Kingdom of Germany\"\".  There really is no term more convenient to call him or it.    \"\n",

The only thing that needs to be changed is that the numbers of those killed needs to increase significantly. I know there was a lot more than 3,000 people killed. The Government furthermore did indeed organize the massacres. Not to mention the government soldiers were committing massacres against Tamils in Northern Sri Lanka, the same time Tamils were massacred in Southern Sri Lanka around Colombo in 1983, which apparently is the \"\"capital\"\" of the \"\"entire\"\" Sri Lankan Country!? Plus what makes this all nonsense is that there are massacres against Tamils continuing today. The Sri Lankan military (armed by: India, Pakistan, Israel, USA, Great Britain, China, Australia, Russia) has already killed 100s of Tamils in Sambur in a Northern Town of Sri Lanka. I think that its time to admit all truths, because lying and denying won't get us anywhere. This is becoming a cat and mouse game.

Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies.

      " an incident has occurred within the church involving some type of sexual scandal. There is a discussion between the churches ip and members of Wikipedia if this  Between 1984 and 1989 John Langworthy was a youth minister at Prestonwood Baptist Church. On January 22nd, 2013, Langworthy pled guilty to five of eight felony counts of gratification of lust against young boys, receiving a suspended sentence of 50 years. He was also required to register as a sex offender. The offences occurred at Morrison Heights Baptist Church in Clinton, MS.[11] It was reported that Langworthy also admitted, in a pulpit confession, to prior sex offenses at Prestonwood Baptist Church. Some of the alleged victims made complaints to Prestonwood Church at the time, which were dealt with internally by church officials.[12] There are now allegations that Prestonwood Baptist Church covered up Langworthy's offenses by failing to report them to the proper authorities.

It's a festival that is supposed to encourage active involvement from local communities, t is a not for profit festival that is funded by the state in the UK via Arts Council England. We're not trying to advertise but trying to describe the whole ethos of the festival which is participation. In it's inaugural year it is still trying to find its identity so we don't have a huge definition except for \"\"get involved\"\". I apologise if this is constituting as advertising, but the festival is meant to create a platform for artists to present their work in different communities. Is their anything I can do in this circumstance that wouldn't constitute the page as an advert? The festival is also run each year by 5 young producers to increase their skills in producing and to help them find work after the project and it aims to do that year on year.\n",

To be clear, Government funded sources include academia, and they are also less verifiable if not freely accessible.  What makes basic income special is that, unlike virtually every other political proposition, the Champion of basic income gains no privilege whatsoever over other citizens, and so the only reason to champion UBI is to provide freedom and dignity to everyone.  The relevance is that there is no business model for power accumulation behind it, and that affects the sources available.  Limiting information sources to entrenched power sources (Government, academia and corporate) stacks the deck with biased point of view in favour of power structures, or in the case of the state of this page, makes it impossible to describe UBI.  There is great content available on the web for UBI.  Academic work is more timid, less accessible, and often of lower quality than other research on UBI.\n",

Discouraging (without banning) month and day of birth or death is not consensus, although it is the strong opinion of many editors, disputed by many others, at at a straw poll currently being  conducted at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers). Since Jane Austen's editors have apparently decided against having an Information Box (which could display exact birthday and date of death), I think the argument for keeping them quickly accessible in this particular lead is rather stronger. And although I'm more of a Dickensian than an Austenite myself, I know several people in the San Francisco Bay Area who diligently celebrate Jane Austen's birthday with an annual ball. So in my book her birthday would fall in the same class as that of Abraham Lincoln (Kentucky, February 12, 1809 — Washington, D.C., April 15, 1865).\n",
