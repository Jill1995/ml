      "\"First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion \"\"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary\"\" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank 'I know more about Wiki than you' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.  \n",

You can justify the \"\"childish rampage\"\" comment, but I can justify the action in that when you don't feel you can deal with someone, you resort to tit-for-tat measures to see how they like having their content targeted, monitored like a hawk for excising/editing like he had been doing, and show disrespect by never contacting the other person by the 2nd or so time.

In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin's landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.\n",

Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.\n",

In my view, the way he is working over an entire article to achieve this is further evidence that, while it violates NPOV, he is not doing it maliciously as other self promoters do. His willingness to discuss puts him well above the bar of the usual self promoter. and he's not pushing his only publications as viable sources nor is he unwilling to seek consensus.

      "Hi, Benne. Thank you for unearthing this need for disambiguation. I think that Mansura is usually spelled with a ta marbuta as its final letter: منصورة (manṣūrä). This comes frot the root نصر (naṣara) meaning 'help' or 'make victorious' (interestingly, in derived form II it means 'Christianize'). Therefore, منصور (manṣūr) means 'helped', 'supported', 'victorious'. The place name is the feminine version of this, perhaps representing the old accusative (with locative meaning). In Arabic, many place names begin with the definite article. Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's transliterated as Al and sometimes it's El. The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura, Mansoura, Mansoora, Mansurah, Mansourah, Mansoorah, Mansureh, Mansoureh, Mansooreh. It would make sense to have all of these alternatives, with and without alternatives of definite article, linking to a disambiguation page. However, the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these, so it might take precedence over the disambig. I'll see if I can tidy it up a little. —\n",

      "Malcolmxl5 Per your advice, I've located documentation of artist Samizu Matsuki's painting awards of 1970 and 1971 and added an external link to it on her wikipedia biography. It consists of excerpts from the book \"\"Artists/USA 1972-73 - Guide to Contemporary Art\"\"; Library of Congress Catalog Number 78134303. ISSN: 0196-6154.  Would you assess the worthiness of the reference for documenting her awards? See http://penbay.org/samizu/awards/samizu_awards.html.

In addition, Israel is in violation of UN resolution 242, the 2002 UN , on Torture, as well as other well documented human rights abuses. To not mention these at all and to just point the finger at the Palestinians for violating international law does a great disservice to this article and makes it have a very biased POV.

      "\n",
      "In the \"\"related ethnic groups\"\" section you have included Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, but excluded Welsh. This makes no sense, and it had been agreed by all editors that the Welsh are among the closest ethnic groups to the English, as anyone familiar with those two peoples knows. Your argument appears to be that the Welsh should not be included because they are English - as a result of the 1536 legislation that annexed Wales to the English kingdom. I can only assume that you have no idea what ethnicity actually means, and I suggest you read the article about it. In short, ethnicity has nothing whatsoever to do with legislation, and the mere annexation of Wales to England did not extinguish Welsh ethnic identity. But you don't need to take my word for it, just look at the Welsh people page. And nor, incidentally, is ethnicity dependent on race or genetics. You have accused me of being a racist, but it is you who are the racist by insisting that ethnicity is defined by race. As for Danes and Norwegians, their inclusion is arguable (though not so much the Swedes - very few of them settled in England). The agreed consensus prior to your unilateral intervention was that no Continental ethnic groups would be included, on the grounds that the inhabitants of the British Isles are much, much closer to each other in terms of culture, history, and language than any groups from mainland Europe. Again, this fact is obvious to anyone who knows them. As a Canadian, it is possible that you may have been ignorant of this. If you are not familiar with a subject, it is probably a good idea not to make edits to its page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further down the article you have inserted a sentence saying that the Tudors are the chief representative of the English kingdom. This is not only false, it is also completely irrelevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still further down you have completely mangled the section dealing with the Norman Conquest and its effects. You have deliberately suppressed the historical fact that the English became a conquered nation, and inserted irrelevant descriptions of coats of arms. You then suddenly lurch into a (false) description of Neolithic Britain and Gaul, as if this was in any way relevant to the Norman Conquest. You then mention the Roman Empire and one of its short-lived breakaway states, jumping straight to Offa and Charlemagne, desperate to clutch at any sort of straw that will lend support, however flimsy, to your own preconceived notion that no distinction should be made between the English and the French (despite the obvious fact that these two peoples have a very different language, culture, and ethnic identity). Your mention of the consolidation of kingdoms around capitals such as Winchester and Paris is also completely irrelevant, and your suggestion that the English Channel has been the main focus of English cultural development is demonstrably wrong - the North Sea has been just as important, usually more so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving further down still, you have inserted a whole new section entitled \"\"Royalty\"\", and it is here that you expose the full extent of your total misunderstanding of (a) what the article is about, and (b) the English people. English identity is not based on coats of arms as symbols. If you want evidence of this, look at the World Cup, being played in Germany as we speak. The English fans, almost to a man, carry the flag of St. George, and only very rarely the Union Jack. They never, ever carry the royal coat of arms in any form. Being Canadian, I suspect that you have received a rather distorted view of the English through Holywood depictions and the like. The vast majority of English people would laugh in the face of the sort of mediavalist aristocratic fantasy that you are espousing. You then go on to claim that all Englishmen are actually descended from royalty! This is patent nonsense, and once again exposes your own royalist fantasies. The medieval French-speaking monarchy deliberately did not interbreed with its English-speaking subjects. Now, I'm not saying that no genetic material from earlier monarchs exists in the modern English population, but that is not the point. Statistically, every single person on earth might be descended from Julius Caesar, or anyone else you care to name who lived long enough ago. Oh, and French is most definitely not a lingua franca used among Englishmen - we don't need one, because we've already got English. Indeed, English people in general have been notoriously bad at learning foreign languages. And all that guff ab\n",

      "I quoted above from Syracuse University's web site  the \"\"four core areas of philosophy\"\" that students must study are The History of Philosophy, Ethics and Moral Theory, Metaphysics and The Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology), and Logic. Now from Harvard University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from 1. Logic, 2. Contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, 3. Ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and 4. History of ancient, medieval, or modern pre-20th-century philosophy. Stanford University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from Logic, Philosophy of science, Moral and political philosophy, Metaphysics and epistemology, and History of philosophy. Major research universities seem to agree that all undergrad. phil. majors must take a logic course (and, incidentally, that metaphysics and epistemology can be lumped together at this level). While what undergrads. must take is hardly the be-all and end-all of phil., it certainly indicates to me that logic is a major area in the minds of academic philosophers. I also consider \"\"The Development of Logic\"\" by Kneale and Kneale  to support this position; from pg. 1 it puts \"\"not simply valid argument but the reflection on principles of validity\"\" in the context of Plato and Aristotle. (Of course they also discuss it in the context of math.) I contend that logic is a central area of phil. and merits conclusion alongside ethics and metaphysics/epistemology as the three major areas of phil.  \"\n",

However if evolution is accepted as fact, then teleological arguments on the origin of religion cannot be considered scientific, in which case the evolutionary theories on the origin of religion and \"\"origin of religion\"\" are the same.   \n",

Also the logic you present above is simply not correct at all.  The fact that human physiology is a product of biological evolution does not mean that the origin of religion can be explained through evolutionary mechanisms or as a product of biological evolution.  Perhaps without the evolution of certain cognitive capacities human practices like religion would not be possible, but the origin of religion itself may be entirely \"\"social\"\" or \"\"cultural\"\" given a certain state of cognitive evolution.  If that were the case then theories of religion's origin would not be evolutionary theories at all, yet they would be equally \"\"scientific\"\" and clearly non-religious in nature.  That is to say biological evolution itself is not necessarily causal of religion, even if it may be necessary to create a certain precondition (e.g. a capacity for symbolic thought) for religious belief.  \n",

      "We have a content dispute that is mainly between myself and you. Dbachmann occasionaly gets involved switching between sides. But essentially this is between me and you. This is why we are not making progress, because we do not have any editors who are willing to dedicate the time and effort to work on this this. Consequently you are taking advantage of this lack of editors and you are using an old AFD as your leverage, because you can run to any admin, who only know the rules and know little about content. This is unfair and unacademic and is very political. Dbachmann knows very well that the articles I created are valid. He has admitted that he agrees in principal with the ideas I have presented, but simply disagrees with me because he dislikes my demeanor User_talk:Dbachmann#origin_of_religion. I had worked on the article \"\"Origin of language\"\" using the same approach. Before I started working on the origin of language, the topic was approached from a psychological or sociological perspective filled with archaic fringe and opinionated theories. I proceeded to add the evolutionary perspective to the article, after which Dbachmann reviewed the article with some refactoring he upgraded the article to B-class. I used the same approach on the origin of religion only to be met with some of the worst hostility to knowledge. As I often mention, you had even disputed the out of Africa hypothesis, or that grave goods are considered evidence of a belief in the afterlife . Here you are seen to be making up your own theories. So I do feel justified to doubt the credibility of some of your assertions and also some of the other editors. I have always asked admins and a lot of other editors to assist in dispute resolution, but many seem content with pushing buttons and chasing after vandals and boosting their egos by blocking people, they have no interest in content. So I propose to go for dispute resolution, if you think you have a case, you should opt for it. If you are afraid and want to continue using the archaic AFD as your silver bullet, then this dispute will needlessly continue. Of course the result will be blocks of which I am the top candidate, but what a waste that would be. Who would be there to provide education on grave goods.   \n",

If the facts I've written are wrong then you clearly ought first to make changes to the peak oil article where there are some who can argue the toss with you. If however you dispute the facts, then again you ought to check the peak oil article and make sure that it adequately notes contrary points of view (if you can source them) - but that does not in itself negate the need for the link. But on your specific point - its a bit rich having someone complain about peak oil which has a proven record of making at least some verifiable predictions within a few years when Global warming is still at the stage of a 3:1 range between lowest and highest predictions!\n",

The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. \n",

      "Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. \n",

      "On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). \n",

However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer \"\"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession.\"\" Id. at 8.1(a). \n",
      "\n",
      "The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. \n",

      "The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. \n",

At the time a close variant of this statement was first inserted into the article, there was an then ongoing discussion relating to the inclusion of the Time Magazine cover image involving WP technical minutiae relating to WP:NFC. In my opinion and that of other participants, it was a reasonable editorial discretionary decision to include it, though the precise formulation plainly is questionable and subject to debate in particular about the second and third question presented. That question reads: \"\"If so, does the evidence support it and related explanations of the history of life on Earth?\"\" It's followed by the assertion that \"\"if the answer to either question is negative\"\" then the third question follows. IMO, this, although reasonable, is just edItorial opinion. The paragraph with the three questions was just very recently flagged for citation, which according to a strict reading of WP:V allows for its removal, at least lacking a consensus override of its removal. After initially resisting, I support its removal. .....

      " the dried form of Cannabis that is smoked most frequently should form its own article. This article would initially cover how the dried form is prepared, the legal penalties of various locales, the use of this dried variant, and how it is smoked, as well as any notable scientific information regarding the dried form. I would appreciate help getting this done. I'm making this discussion the start of the article, and in time it will evolve into a page of its own, at which point we can decide on a better title, if there is one. In fact, does anyone have any better suggestions than \"\"Dried Cannabis\"\"? Some have suggested \"\"Marijuana\"\", but that would be too ambiguous with Cannabis (drug). I personally think that a title that is sourced would be best.\"\n",

      " If some metals form an alloy this alloy has specifics of its own, not a combination of the different metals it is made up of. I'm pretty sure the following declaration is nonsense from a sientific point of view (emphasis mine): The overtones are a result of using an alloy consisting of multiple metals, each producing its own overtone. New bowls can also produce multiple harmonic overtones if they are high quality bronze, but many are made from a simpler alloy and produce only a principal tone and one harmonic overtone. I have heard a cast iron bowl with a very impressive rich tone - and that is a very simple alloy...\n",
      " Additionally the term \"\"aging process\"\" in the following paragraph and the last sentence of the section \"\"Antique singing bowls\"\" needs a sientific explanation: The aging process greatly improves the tone and centuries old antiques produce an incredibly rich and beautiful sound. I'm pretty sure the beautifully sounding antique singing bowls were sounding equally rich at their producing time. You don't find lousy antique bowls today because as soon as their metal worth exceeded their beauty or practical worth as a container at any time in the past they were molten down.\n",

One fighter squadron, VA-34, known as the 'Blue Blasters,' did get airborne but was prohibited from engaging the enemy. It has been reported that some of those American combat pilots were actually in tears. All was in readiness, but at the last moment, orders came from the White House to cancel fighter support for the invading [exiled] Cubans. Only President Kennedy and his brother, Bobby, knew why this decision was made. It was a U.S.-planned and U.S.-financed operation and, in the end, it was a U.S. decision that led to disaster for the invasion force and permitted Castro to remain in power.\"\"\"\n",

Anyway, the futuki are generally masked and wear feathered cloaks, and are indistinguishable from each other, at least in this world. During one of the many interesting flashback montage’s, we see not only the long line of them, but one watching Mugen from the road through the forest, and a couple of other spots, which suggests to me that he's someone they're keeping an eye on.

      "I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to \"\"dumb down\"\" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.\n",

The parachute pack clipped-on to the harness at the front (chest) and only needed to be attached immediately before jumping. For confined rear turrets the pack was sometimes stored outside the turret in the fuselage, the gunner only needing to reach behind him to open the two rear doors of the turret and reach into the fuselage. Where the tail gunner stowed his parachute depended on personal preference and to some extent, on his physical size.\n",

With the increasing later use of such apparel as Irvin jackets and Mae Wests and other impedimenta the average crew member became a much bulkier figure, leading to difficulties in exiting the aircraft in an emergency, the dimensions of the escape hatches remaining unchanged. This possibly accounts for the higher crew losses for the Lancaster compared to the Halifax, which was also much roomier inside.\n",

I'm saying that it is not necessary to hum every voice concurrently to claim to be able to hum something, especially since a fugue only has (usually) one or two melodies despite it having multiple *voices*.   \"\n",

      "Fyi (and I really don't think I should need to have to point this out) my goal in this case was simply to help provide genuinely reliable information on Wikipedia in a clinically relevant topic. That's to say, in the knowledge that patients really do come to Wikipedia as a source of information, and that the information they find may influence their decisions. However, I'm human and my patience has its limits. Right now it's seething. I should say that in other circumstances I would be happy to hear your advice on how to use those templates. But here, I'm afraid it all rings hollow. Whenever did I mention a block? (Fwiw, I might well have supported a limited topic ban, if I'd prioritize ANI over tidying a new article [Wikipedia_talk:MED#New_article:_Dutch_hypothesis].) Anyway, I did my best, and that's that. And I've got bitten for my pains. But I sometimes feel that's pretty much par for the course when trying to help out on anything controversial (however relevant its implications) on Wikipedia. A real trap, imo.\n",

      "\"You've made a mistake. I was pointing out that those described as \"\"black\"\" are under-represented on this site. It you go to the Talk Page of the Big Bill Broonzy article you will read a post I left in January of 2013 where I mentioned this issue. No one asked women if they wanted the vote - it was the Suffragettes who put the proposal on the table. Now that women in Egypt have the vote does that mean we should disenfranchise them because the European Suffragettes from one hundred years ago didn't ask them if they wanted to be represented? I was pointing out in the examples given above that representation is not served by those who are not of the group seeking representation and that representation itself is a form of dialogue that does not arrive fully formed. Airline pilots work in consultation with the civil aviation authority to improve and implement safety measures for air travel and this affects all who travel by air. People what we have here is someone who read into my post what they wished to see written and not what was actually written. I also highlighted at the Broonzy Talk Page that this issue is a point of divergence between Wikipedia editors. I mentioned in the post above that this needs to be discussed here because we (all of us here regardless of background genetics) need to ask those who are being described as \"\"black\"\" if they wish to join this site to affect the consensus guideline. Anyway you boring me now with your lack of original ideas - bring something of your own to the table rather than falling back on misreading and misinterpretation. You are being facetious, negative, evasive and living up to your username of SqueakBox. If you insist on burying this issue on a Guideline proposal page then the issue dies because we don't have enough \"\"blackie\"\" editors as it is and it will become just a minor discussion between a few Wikipedia editors who probably are not of the group being described and discussed. This article will have many African and West Indian readers whereas the Village Pump, RFC and other such pages will have very few. Look I really need to get back to writing articles for the database for the Enterprise NX-01 - I have a lot of faith in Nasa and the American people's desire to explore space.

It is so suspicious, that is why I question his objectivity, and point out that he IS a PAID agent of tax dollars vested in a particular model. That he doesn't acknowledge and recuse himself, is just annoying to say the least.  That Wikipedia doesn't impose some boundaries on this user's blinding conflict of interest, casts a far greater doubt upon Wikipedia NPOV all together.  \"\n",

      "The background of the former is completely skewed, as you note. The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .\n",

      "In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, \"\"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away.\"\" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, \"\"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,\"\" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. \n",

      "There are only two points on which Morris' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel's original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling \"\"an unplanned 'exchange of population.'\"\" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians' defining national ethos. \n",
      "Morris' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi'a Talhuq's book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt's prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of \"\"atheism and nihilist Communism.\"\" And the Zionists' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948. After the defeat, rather than pursuing jihad against Israel, the conservative Arab regimes signed an armistice agreement granting legitimacy to Israel's 1948 borders. And between 1949 and 1952, they all attempted to reach permanent peace agreements with the Jewish state.  Shlomo Ben-Ami A War to Start All Wars, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2008.

      "Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.\n",
      "Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.\n",
      "Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and \"\"hump\"\" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.\n",

      "A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.\n",
      "Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.\n",
      "A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.\n",
      "Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before \"\n",

      "\"Spinal manipulation is a regulated/controlled medical intervention and can only be performed by chiropractors and a limited number of physical medicine professionals. Prior to the adminstration of spinal manipulative therapy, absolute contraindications must be screened out.  These include inflammatory arthritides, fractures, dislocations, instabilities, bone weakening disorders, tumours, infections, acute trauma as well as various circulatory and neurological disorders. Although most contraindications apply only to spinal manipulation of the affected region, a few emergency conditions, such as visual field defects is an absolute contraindication spinal manipulative therapy.   In February 2008, the World Health Organization sponsored Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders, the largest and most comprehensive study on neck pain, diagnosis, prognosis and safety to date. This included a consensus of the top experts in the world whose findings were collated using a best-evidence synthesis, which addresses risk, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment risks and benefits.

      "no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care.\n",

The most common minor side effect was  pain in the head, neck, arm or upper back; and stiffness of the neck, shoulder which occurred after, at worst, 16 in 1,000 (0.016%) treatments.  Furthermore, the authors concluded that the risk of serious adverse effects was, at worst, 6 per 100,000 (0.006%) spinal manipulations.

The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent \"\"The Face\"\" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in \"\"The Severed Alliance\"\", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in \"\"Songs That Saved Your Life\"\" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: \"\"Oh Linder. Oh Linder.

      "The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from \"\"something\"\". Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   \n",
      "Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the \"\"concept of God\"\" uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.\n",

They have a tendency to overreach, exaggerating the roles of Japanese gangsters and ex-military American bit-players when the bankers, politicians and CIA operatives are scary enough. They know the Philippines well, but are unreliable on Japan and do not read Japanese. The book is full of errors that could easily be corrected by a second-year student of the language – the ship they repeatedly call the Huzi is accurately romanised Fuji; the important Japan Sea port is Maizuru, not Maisaru; tairiki is not a Japanese word: they mean tairiku ronin (a ‘Continental adventurer’ or a ‘China carpetbagger’); and their mysterious Lord Ichivara is an absurdity – no one was ever called ‘Lord’ in postwar Japan and Ichivara is an impossible name (it is surely Ishihara).”?

      "About so called caste formation in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It is not a separate process, most sociologists and linguist call the shared cultural region as Tamilakam. In Wiki we have to rewrite the article to reflect this reality. If you read the Kerala and Malayalam entries, and www.kerlahistory.com site this new idea is brought out. Hence Kerala and Tamil Nadu are hitched at the hips up-until the 10 century regarding their cultural development. \n",
      "\n",
      "Caste itself is not a proper word to describe the social condition of South Asia. What is more accurate is Jati and Varna.  According to linguists like Proff Hart of Berkeley and others, indigenous societies specifically in South India there already were societal cleavage based on certain lineages that were slowly cornering certain economic productive mechanisms such as cultivation, fishing, security, drumming, bards etc. This was in response to a move away from hunter gatherers to slash and burn to settled agriculture and cattle herding. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Sangam literature which is a kaleidoscope of the social conditions prevalent in ancient Cera, Chola and Pandya countries describes a situation where there was a lot of flux and violence used to maintain the economic advantages. In this milieu the northern ideas and people were also added their system such as the Varna. But in reality what the Brahmins  did was to become just another Jati to fit the local model already prevailing and added religious sanction on top of the violence that is needed to maintain the Jati system . Thus  Brahminism, Jainism and Buddhism were  very important in pacifying the populace that lead to the development of later great empires. \n",
      "\n",
      "The word Pulaiti and Pulayan are used in Sangam literature to describe people serving chiefs. They were attached to the wealthy because apparently they were dispossessed or had nothing to independably live on. The name of the Kannadiga caste is Holeya. Where Hole in archaic Kannada means menstrual blood thus indicating that even before Tamil and Kannada became independent certain lineages may have become debased. As you know that’s a long time ago:)) \n",
      "\n",
      "Why is ancient Tamilakam important as opposed to rest of India to understand the unique caste system. Because it was the last frontier to succumb to Indo Aryan population and cultural advance into South Asia. Further it maintained its cultural independence just enough to record (via the Sangam literature) the prevailing conditions before culturally becoming part of rest of India after the Bhakthi period. Today so called separate Keralite and Tamil cultures are just another appendages of a greater Indian culture with minor regional variations.\n",

It was MUCH better the original way, although, as I said, it needs to be supported by cited sources. So when you say it's \"\"extreme,\"\" that's an understatement. Of course it's extreme.

Many people in the UK (including me) believe that in time, the proceedings so far will prove to have been a major miscarriage of justice and UK newspapers are increasingly reporting it as such e.g. London Evening Standard - 14-10-10.  The case is notable, not just as another  murder, but for the breathtakingly incompetent nature of the investigation and for the internet wide sociological phenomena of a modern day 'witch hunt' pursued by those who think that Knox and Sollecito are guilty.  The entry above illustrates this.  The introduction of racism into the debate is unnecessary.  The protagonists need to be judged on evidence.  Implying that race is a factor is arguably inflammatory and seeks to divert attention from the evidence.  It is a good idea for Wikepedia to seek to present as full a picture of the proceedings as possible including the post trial phenomena of internet trolling on the subject.  Legal proceedings are ongoing and a second trial is about to start so this story is far from over.\n",

Generally \"\"x86\"\" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with \"\"86\"\", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as \"\"x86\"\" are IA-32 compatible software, and use \"\"x64\"\" or \"\"x86-64\"\" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. \n",

      "2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"\"x86\"\" is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! \"\"x86\"\" is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture.

      "\n",
      "This is already covered under the second paragraph of the Gameplay section, specifically: \"\"The campaign allows the player to assume control of a faction of the time period, and build a civilization, economy and military in order to conquer other factions. Gameplay consists of controlling the faction's military, economic, and social systems via a large campaign map. During the player's turn, armies, fleets, and agents can be moved on the map. When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Armies are formed from 'Units' normally consisted of 20-30 men for artillery, 30-40 men for cavalry and 60-70 men for infantry or archers. In adition to this a general can also recruit mercenaries for a price if need be. An army can consist of up to twenty units, or as little as one, and will move according to the units it contains. This means that an army consisting entirely of cavalry can cover a lot of ground in one turn, but would be able to cover a much shorter distance were the army to have any artillery or infantry units. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that this falls under http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information specifically section 4, Instruction Manuals. The specific number of people in a unit isn't significant except in the context of the game, nor are unit speed, the ability to recruit mercenaries and army size limits (since they are artificial limits established by the game designers.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A general can be selected from amongst your family to lead the army, and he will benefit or hinder the army based on his personal traits, a General who starts fighting when he is young is more likely to develop a keen skill for combat that one who has spent most of his life governing a city. The risk is that should the army be beaten then the General may die, and even during a battle that is going in your favour your general can still get cut off, surrounded by the enemy or hit by a stray arrow. Losing a general can bring an end to a generation if he were the only son without an heir, which can affect your whole family tree for generations. An army without a general is lead by a captain, who will fight alongside whichever unit you select as the first unit in your army. A captain who performs well in battle may be promoted to General, and be adopted into your family. These generals are generally better suited to combat rather than Govenment roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generals are already covered under Agents and Characters: \"\"In addition to their agents, each faction is ruled by a family, the male members of which act as generals in battle. Each general has a number of attributes which determine how well he governs a settlement and how well he leads an army in battle. A general's actions can affect his attributes- for example, a general who routinely kills prisoners of war may see his \"\"dread\"\" increase, making him frightening to foes; a general who prefers to release prisoners may instead increase his \"\"chivalry\"\", which makes his own troops braver.\"\"\n",

Training and forming a working army is an expensive and lengthly process, and traveling to fight the enemy can take even longer, so the aim of every Battle during the campaign is to kill or capture as many of the enemy as possible, while minimizing the loss to your own army, thus allowing you to carry on fighting for longer with the same army.

The problem is so widespread now (because it involves so many articles) that I don't even know where to begin to try to get the mess cleaned up. I'm sure her initial intentions were good when she thought it would be a good idea to put singers' vocal ranges into their articles, but when editors started reverting over and over again, and she kept reverting back, she obviously realized there was a problem. I can't get her to understand that even though a particular fact can be sourced, doesn't mean it's worthy of being included in a Wikipedia article. (However, many/most of her sourcing fails the reliability test.) Since this involves a huge number of articles, and not just a couple articles, how do you get Tribal to stop doing this in articles?

      " What Toptchyan wrote is that after Malkhasyants (1940, and Sarkissian's article is from March 1940, so just before it) and untill Toumanoff (1961), thus \"\"second half of the 20th century\"\", there has been no serious scholarship opposing the 5th c. dating. You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, \"\"la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies\"\" or in English \"\"the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades\"\"). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't \"\"remain\"\" disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing \"\"revived\"\" the critical points in 1961.\n",
      " Where you perhaps have a point (with \"\"remains\"\") is that Toumanoff's main point, the \"\"Bagratids argument\"\", had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).\n",
      " I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (\"\"revived... continue to maintain\"\"). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.\n",

It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true. master \"\n",

I have not placed any cites as I did not write the section originally. What I think we can do is, go from here, place in the relevent cite requests, and attempt to clean up this section. NOTES- (1)I left in the last sentence of the first paragraph. While it might be seen as \"\"original research\"\" it is a fact, I'd prefer to let it go with a cite request to at least give someone else a chance to make it better. (2)I left in the last three paragraphs which you think don't deserve attention, however it is true, and this behavior definitely deserves attention in a \"\"comments and criticisms\"\" section. I think the problem here is that it is not a clean section. The current wording certainly is of an axe grinding nature, but can be cleaned up and sourced to become good information. Here is the original section I've pulled from-\n",
      "Personally, I prefer this info to be integrated into the article more seamlessly, but I have accepted \"\"comments/criticism\"\" sections as a necessary part of these types of articles as there tends to be no other way to share this information without damaging the integrity of the article. Insertion of information regarding Hitler's abuse of drugs after his assasination attempt, or Exxon's treatment of the Valdez incident, and subsequent hand wringing over the suit, to all be examples of pertinent info regarding individuals and companies that can easily be perverted to a non-objective position, but are still highly valuable when done correctly.\n",
      "So this done, let's all take it easy. Those who think it is a poor section please leave it and place in your cite requests. Those who think it deserves to stay can work to find those cites and clean it up. This can and will become a good section if we let it be and allow for the open source machine to work it's magic. \n",

That is what makes me suggest you are a FYROM supporter (it was not meant as a pejorative simply a description of your political leanings). If you wish others to believe you have a NPOV it would require a more careful selection of words on your part and a far more even handed editing history when it comes to the main article.

I therefore pointed out the House bill (which you have made absolutely no mention of) had over 120 members supporting it which I belive made it was one of the largest supported foreign bills of the year actually. I don't think it is unreasonable to suggest when a fair chunk of the government of the world's most powerful nation (heavily involved with mediating the naming issue) makes a complaint that severe... it should be completely negated from the article. As for you opinion that it (or a child bill) won't become more binding... my own opinion is that will largely be up to the behavior of FYROM government and whether they \"\"abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage\"\".\n",

Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many \"\"the Nazis\"\" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the \"\"Nazis\"\" who came from \"\"Greenland or Mars\"\" or \"\"Nazi allies\"\". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. \"\"The German-led Nazi occupation\"\" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the \"\"General Government\"\" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. \n",

Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest.

There's also the meaning of descent, in anthropology descent does not by necessity have have to have a biological reality, some ethnic groups claim a common descent from gods, or totems.

      "Henry Cornelius Burnett (1825–1866) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Kentucky and a Confederate States Senator. He represented Kentucky's 1st congressional district during the lead-up to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a sovereignty convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Burnett's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress, and he was expelled from the House in 1861. After the war, he was indicted for treason, but was never tried. He returned to the practice of law, but died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40. (more...)\n",

It is you and you little clique that are trying to impose on people there view of where people live.

      "The film opens with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb and shooting a large bolt of lightning into the sky. It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.\n",
      "At Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is \"\"unyielding\"\" and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.\n",

      "DICTATORSHIP OR DEMOCRACY - It's an excellent point to say that it's pointless and misleading to demonise Barnes. Clearly, there was a qualitative change in the politics of the SWP during the 1980s. Barnes clearly played a leading role in this process, but had the national committee majority behind him. Most would also say that the SWP organisational and democratic norms changed: those who were expelled, such as the Fourth International Tendency, argued it was done undemocratically and wrong-headedly.\n",
      "BREAKING WITH TROTSKYISM - This seems a fair description of the SWP's evolution. However, if the SWP feel it unfair, it would be better to write of a \"\"break with Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution and the struggle to build the Fourth International.\"\" In so far as Trotsky agrees with the Leninism, and opposition to Stalinism and the third period, the SWP agree with him. However, Trotskyism clearly refers to the politics of the movement that Trotsky and the SWP founded: the FI. The defining aspects of that movement: permanent revolution in the developing world; anti-bureaucratic revolution in the workers' states and the notion of socialist democracy. Of course, the SWP no longer calls itself Trotskyist and the word is dropped, for example, from the title of Joseph Hansen's book on Cuba.\n",
      "CASTROISM - Similary, it is mistaken to call the SWP a Castoist party. The SWP's 'New International' strategy in the 1980s and 1990s was one of convergence with the Castroist current. However, it's clear that the SWP has its own ideology.\n",

      "Daniel Vincent Kelley's Theory regarding this phrase\n",
      "First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as \"\"lessons\"\" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.\"\n",

If something is described in a way that is inaccurate, or even substantially unhelpful in terms of communication of the knowledge of the article, I believe that any encyclopedia that will be useful, broadly and in the longterm, must have an established way of discarding/correcting/replacing such content. Now, if one carte balance removes absolutely awful incorrect, incomplete, misleading, etc.) content, you are perceived as the scofflaw—even if you made essentially the same required, professional correction to a 2nd year's university or 1st year graduate trainee's paper a week earlier. Hence, I have finished fighting about this (see my User page).  I will work to get it right before submitting, and engage in a month of replies to discussion. If, in that time, the content issue cannot be resolved without entering into any current (or currently debated replacement) dispute resolution arena—I will punt, and do the rest I describe at my User page. ( Life is simply too short, knowledgable users too little empowered, and system to titanic in nature.)  That said, note/realize, I am a scientist, and understand that as one moves from the sciences to other areas of intellectual endeavor, the process of arriving at what is an accurate reflection on a subject would need to be modified, perhaps substantially. My view is that one needs real, senior editors, with editorial control. But you can guess how far that proposal will fare.\n",

In struggling to maintain that balance, we editors often find ourselves in conflict.  I believe that's what is happening here.  Jason's 'importance' is POV.  He was barely mentioned in the original crisis, and only because his return to life was attributed to Superboy-Prime did his return elicit Infinite Crisis attention.  We have no idea how important he'll end up being in Countdown, since they change these things on the fly, and we'd be speculating if we were to state anything beyond what has happened.  Remember, this article should not be a substitute for reading the comics.

As to the content of the SeaWorld article itself, it needs work ... no question. Clean out the marketing spin and focus on SeaWorld's history prior to its acquisition by Anheuser-Busch (at which point it became part of Busch Entertainment Corporation, which is now SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment). As to \"\"favorable vs. unfavorable,\"\" if that's truly how I felt, such incidents articles wouldn't exist. I've gone through with SpikeJones and other editors to keep everything consistent, first getting involved with them after the monorail accident in July 2009, when this exact same issue came up, and again consensus was that leaving out the victim's name didn't damage the article, nor did it add any significant value to it (at which point, tie goes to \"\"leave it out\"\"). After that, it was the rash of lewd-behavior incidents at Central Florida water parks ... again, if I was trying to protect the parks, I wouldn't have allowed the information in, as if it were completely up to me, anyway. Heck, I added a number of them into their respective articles, and I fleshed out others with more details and more source information to back it all up! (In the interest of full disclosure, the victims in those incidents were generally minors, which (a) wouldn't have been named by the news and (b) if some unscrupulous person had gotten a hold of the names, I have no doubt the names would be expunged immediately and nobody who really had the project's best interests at heart would put up a fight.

Not to my surprise it was met with a quick revert. I understand the editors argument that the colour for seasons 1 and 3 are quite similar, but in all honesty it does not matter. The two seasons are not directly chronological in nature, therefore there is no issue with differentiation. Following some sort of makeshift standard is desirable when it comes to the colour schemes on television seasons because it keeps petty arguments and debates from arising, similar to the ones above.

Positive statements on Jefferson was that he was a humane slaveowner, mentioning his proposal to stop slavery in the West after 1800, and he banned the United States slave trade.

One would have to make a serious jump to non-local hidden variable theories in order to have ANY hidden variable theory. Am I right in saying that there's no evidence or theoretical proof that says information can move faster than the speed of light? How could one even consider hidden variable theories without making that jump to assume information can move faster than the speed of light? Even if the speed of light is beatable, how would we prove it? The bias in the physics section is leaning towards is determinism because it says hidden variable theories could happen, it doesn't mention Bell's theorem, AND it makes a terrible counter-argument to hidden variable theories using that number genorator nonsense. As Gibbzmann said, this seems to put hidden variable deterministic theories on par with indeterministic theories by having Bell's theorem absent. Determinism and hidden variable theories may make people happy, but Bell's theorem says otherwise on the topic of local hidden variable theories.

One has to wonder why such a comment was included in the section on R-L21 in the first place, since, undoubtedly, all the R1b1b2 subclades that are common in the British Isles are also common where immigrants from the British Isles settled.

The several weeks I have been here has been an interesting experience. I learned a lot, wandering around the Random articles. I also tried to contribute on issues that I know well. I had my share of learning other people's academic formation and their inner world (psychologies)i.e. how they react to the unknown or suppressed. As a social scientist, I was surprised to see the magnified importance of the behaviour and perception factors. I think I should learn more on social psychology and related behavioural disciplines to apply in my work. To cut a long story short, I think I have been doing my humble contribution to the WP but believe could have done more in this rather short period, should I not faced reactionary attitudes, especially on \"\"national\"\" issues. It is really astonishing to see how people react to editing events that have occurred before our grandfathers were born, if they suspect their world of conceived reality is threatened. Never mind if these words look confusing to you, because they also are for me. I know I simply received a -perhaps automated- welcome message from you and am not expecting an answer to these lines.

You listed my mishap with WilyD as the main reason for this, stating that I did several things wrong which I get. The misunderstanding was based on a believed piece of policy in my head which was that editors do not generally remove CSD tags (especially when they had been tagged by an admin) but clicked on the \"\"contest this speedy deletion\"\" button. Now I admit fully I was wrong, and don't know where I even got the initial conception from. I then added the template to Wily's user page (and as you mentioned I changed the default text). You said that I did not consider the possibility that I was mistaken, when I did (why else would I have asked another experienced editor for advice?) and then promptly realised my mistake and set about fixing the problem. I do believe that this was an isolated incident, based on a single misconception in my mind that led to one or two other non-brilliant outcomes. However, I would ask that you reconsider your decline, especially as I made a good number of reverts over the last day or so, and I believe that I am getting it right a good deal more often than not. I understand if you decline, as it was not an attractive mistake to make, but I do ask that you reconsider, as I believe that it was more or less a one-off with no other related incidents in the near past (that I can see).

      "Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of \"\"cleansing actions\"\", \"\"master races\"\" and \"\"aryanism\"\" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  \"\"Judaism:  evils of\"\"; \"\"Judaism, need for dissolution of\"\".  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, \"\"that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .\"\"  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not \"\"Nazis\"\"  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.

Can you elaborate specifically what some of those issues are (preferably without commentary in in a short, concise, bulleted list)? That way we can together address those concerns. I agree that, per the BLP page, this could fall under its purview to a small extent. My concern would be that someone in the future starts making sweeping changes (read: deletions) based on IDONTLIKEIT with the BLP as their smokescreen justification. I don't think that's your intent, but at some point it could happen from another. I'm hoping we all can mitigate that possibility now. Thanks in advance for clarifying.  •   •  • \"\n",

Energies are dispersed, and the article becomes lopsided and uneven.  Read the article on Human skin color.  This article discusses the various theories about human skin color.  One scenario is that fair skin is the result of spontaneous, random mutation, that, theoretically, there were white-skinned people (the result of genetic mutations) in Africa, but they simply did not survive to produce progeny; that the same mutations occurred when humans migrated north, but because of the climate, those mutants survived to bear and rear offspring.  Another scenario posits that humans initially were pale like simians, but as they began to lose their hair, their skin darkened over time as a climatic accommodation.  And there are other theories, as well.  You want to get into melanin in this article  and the accompanying sturm und drang of agrument, disagreement and, potentially, more edit warring (just look at what's happened here with a far narrower piece)  and for material that eventually will be cut out, anyway?

My mind is spinning in 100 directions. I really dread any continued judgment by a \"\"jury of sneers\"\" so I doubt I would participate in any forums of that type. Some articles become hopeless chaos, when the masses descend and start hacking with no concept of the topic (\"\"Harry Potter what?\"\"). One of the worst hatchet jobs, to any article, was with \"\"Search engine\"\" where the technical details conflicted with the general concept of searching for \"\"stuff\"\" and people kept deleting those excessive technical parts about ranking pages (not unlike avoiding text about Low copy number DNA, fingerprints, or luminol of Italian fruit juice). It was another case of \"\"too many kooks spoil the broth\"\" and hence, that implies a long-term issue: articles need a limited \"\"roster of active editors\"\" to limit meddling, perhaps have an active count, and when a editor abandons an article, then space opens for another editor to join the roster. The current myth that 500 people can be allowed (to \"\"adjust\"\" an article) is what led to the \"\"Search engine\"\" article becoming a wasteland of chaotic text. Again, it boils down to how should a person choose which articles to develop, versus when they are wasting their expertise in mud-pit articles. It might be much better to develop 100 rarely-trampled articles, rather than fight a POV-stampede within a single article. Plus, it is unsettling to realize they're reading every word of your talk-page and plotting the next insult.

      "\n",
      "The radio production company is Hearts of Space established 25 years ago (35 including the original Music From the Hearts of Space show on KPFA). HoS was historically played on more than 250 USA public radio stations on a scale of 500. This 2004-01-11 San Francisco Chronicle description of Stephen Hill's expertise reads: \n",
      "\"\"Hill, who coined the term \"\"spacemusic\"\" more than 20 years ago, hosts the \"\"Music From the Hearts of Space\"\" music program, syndicated on 250 National Public Radio stations, including San Francisco's KALW 91.7 FM, which airs two hours of the program at 10 p.m. Sundays. In addition, Hill's Hearts of Space Web site (www.hos.com) provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one-hour programs combining ambient, electronic, world, New Age and classical music.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The claim as I understand it (maybe I don't), is that a justified primary source reclassification, along with other sources properly reclassified as primary, would cause a synthesis/OR violation in the article titled Space music. The further result would be that the cofounder's detailed analysis, opinions, and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded. \n",
      "\n",
      "The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a \"\"commercial entity's branding drive\"\". Presumably, he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article, and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it. If I correctly understand it, I can only describe this position as extremist. \n",

Where he's writing about the musicians in the genre, it would seem to me that he is secondary, just like any music critic. -  | Talk \n",

On third-party topics such as music styles, record albums, musicians, the radio and music business, etc, he'd be a secondary source.

I simply know how these things work because I work in the media and have had dealings with the Vatican Press Office — I am on their email list.

      "I actually did get to read through the ones listed above but none of these are truly \"\"great\"\" sources in my view for the entire topic.  My goal in looking through them was to mainly see if they used the term \"\"emphatic mood\"\" and if so whether they applied it as a means of conveying emphasis and further how they then referenced auxiliary do in this sense.  Aside from the usual issue of no one ever having fully bothered to create a decent consensus on mood as a category and within that a standardized naming scheme for moods, the biggest problem I have with most of these sources is that they seem to assume that non-do expressions of emphatic mood via emphasis of other elements is understood, yet none of them actually include such a statement asserting such.  Mulvey refers to such expression in addition to do via auxiliaries in general with examples of emphatic 'will', 'be' and a few others, all established by providing vocal emphasis to those elements.  Beard lists emphatic mood along with a slew of other functions conveyed via auxiliary verbs in general, but doesn't preclude the emphatic (nor any of the other things he's listed) from non-auxiliary expression.  Huddleston seems to infer the use of emphasis in conveying emphatic mood by referring to examples that include neither do nor other auxiliaries, but since he doesn't actually explicitly mark his examples for whatever he is referring to them doing (I suppose he thinks his observations are obvious in each), there's no concrete way of knowing precisely what he is pointing to.  Google turns up thousands of grammars, ESL primers, and language learning websites that all discuss the use of do in conveying the emphatic mood but again just seem to assume the reader knows that emphasis is the means while (when needed) do is the vehicle.  Their wording seems to again point to some presupposed awareness that stressing the desired element is how you convey the emphatic, usually showing examples with non-verbal elements and then other auxiliaries emphasized before stating that do-support comes into play when no other auxiliary is present.  They also provide zero sources so are worth little more than reference value.  \"\n",

      "Once upon a time, there was this guy who'd edited Wikipedia anonybously for many months (let's call him Derek). Derek edited anonymously so regularly hopped from IP address to IP address. He was very happy making contributions to what he believed to be a reputable encyclopedia. He worked as a journalist at a London based newspaper in the real world, and in the virtual world, Wikipedia was one of his many hobbies, where he edited this and that and made a small difference - so he liked to think. But then Derek made a huge mistake - when he tried to take on the cyber bullies - and  and came off the worse for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the afternoon of [[Monday[[ 7 April 2008. Derek had the day off work and was online and browsing Wikipedia. He happened to click on an article about the Radio 2 traffic presenter Sally Bowsman via the random articles button, and he noticed a piece of vandalism. Derek reverted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derek's next move was to look at who had added this piece of vandalism. He knew it was against Wikipedia rules to vandalise pages, so issued a user warning to the chap involved in the vandalism. Derek then decided he would keep an eye on this individual so that he might revert any more vandalism that  might commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lo and behond,  did exactly that. Derek reverted more vandalism and issued further warnings. Even when  made a personal attack against Derek, accusing him of having a personal interest in these other articles, Derek issued the appropriate warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things eventually got to the point where  had used up his four lives - that is, he had been issued with four user warnings; and still  continued to make disruptive edits. Derek therefore decided to approach WP:AIV and report this. Derek then looked at Tom's page history and discovered that he was a regular disruptive editor with rogue edits stretching back over a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A user by the name of  promptly blocked the user. But two hours later, he had what can only be described as an attack of conscience and he unblocked .  didn't really give a reason for this about face other than that he had made a mistake. There then followed some discussion between Derek and Todd, and  even threw in his two penneth. Todd suggested Derek and Tom should chill out. Derek thought that a jolly good idea, and Derek even posted a friendly message on Tom's talk page urging him to make sensible edits - after all, unconstructive edits damage the reputation of Wikipedia, and the thing which damanges Wiki's reputation further is when rogue editors are allowed to continue making rogue edits willy nilly.\n",
      "\n",

      "In chapter nine Burlington, Vermont Kolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact florescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. This agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and Clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan.\n",

I feel I am fairly unbiased, but I believe that the lead should deal more with the definition and explanation of the subject matter than going in depth about its history or disputation. As for going forward, I suggest the following. Once we receive GoldenMeadows' lead draft we'll have three drafts, from which we can choose one to refine and extend (probably incorporating elements from the other drafts as well). Hopefully this will result in a lead which both follows Wikipedia's principles and is accepted by all.\n",

This structure facilitates arm's-length money-raising. It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and Christians.....................................The RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools, but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world - a danger the world has woken up to. Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups' success. They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used.\n",

In addition, all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies. As the names of movies are already given, people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website. Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence. Without this sentence, the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous. In addition, I keep telling you that Cheung's niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression. This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheung's family. However, you stick on introducing this mistake again and again. In addition, Ouyang Feng's job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin, this is easy to verify as the movie's name is given in the article. I don't know why you change it to the wrong one. You also remove the movie link of Happy together. I can't see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error.\n",

If you  do not want to add the articles, as are in the Wikipedia page itself , I could not care less, it is the loss of the readers who do not read about ongoing research with its pros and cons. I thought  it was interesting since I am sure there  are more and that shows a vital field of research. However I take issue with associating Santilli, with fraud, kook, fringe  and I am sure that it is against the rules of Wikipedia on libel and reckless behavior with the clear intent to damage since the fringe scientist definition is not supported by anything of value,  except, perhaps some blogs and  tabloids which, according to the rules, have no source value since they are not peer-reviewed articles!

      "Storm, I saw your note on Trodel's page and wanted to touch base.  I am definately against merging, primarily because placing the topic in History of the Latter Day Saint movement reduces it to a \"\"one time\"\" issue.  The most recent pattern of \"\"faith-promoting\"\" history was (as a BYU trained historian, I sincerely hope) a one time event.  But Mormonism and history is a much bigger topic, closer to historiography, having implications from Joseph's time to the present.  I don't know if this is the right title for such an article, but we are having a restructuring discussion on the Mormonism and history page.  Please drop in and give your two cents.  And, besides, there is certainly little room for more material in History of the Latter Day Saint movement!  Best wishes as always.    \"\n",

      "\"::::::First off, Miles and Blume came to the same conclusion, and Blume said he did interviews, so I'm assuming Miles didn't pull his statements out of his behind and actually talked to some residents about the riots. That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your \"\"proof\"\" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own \"\"proof\"\" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154  \n",

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman.

      "                       Proper History\n",
      "As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\n",

      "Since I'll never be editing Wikipedia again, I thought I'd add a few notes here for the benefit of the few people involved who aren't delusional.  One day, I logged on to discover that I had been accused of being someone else and was facing being banned as a result.  When I objected, instead of being banned for being someone else, I was banned for objecting.  The person who did the banning had been carrying a grudge for literally years, having been caught trying to ban me for similar ludicrously and transparently self-serving reasons years earlier, only to have his malicious action overturned.  In the years since he had been initially caught, the administrators who had cared one way or the other slowly dropped away as Wikipedia slid into its own navel.  A larger and larger proportion of Wikipedia's dwindling contributions are being directed towards bureaucracy and petty politics.  This is always the sign of a community rapid decline.  I do not anticipate that Wikipedia will be relevant for much longer, though it may linger for decades as an increasingly toxic MMORPG for authoritarian sperglords.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proof that this ban has nothing to do with my contributions and everything to do with my legitimate criticism of Wikipedia is that my user page (containing criticism of the systemic biases within Wikipedia and the noxious atmosphere within its community  which had already survived one attempt at censorship through official channels) was gleefully blanked once I no longer had the power to fix it, complete with mocking \"\"buh-bye\"\" commentary.\n",

      "Eric Hoffer wrote, \"\"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.\"\"  I never cared about Wikipedia; I came here because a blatantly libellous biography about me had sat untouched for months and only when it was corrected to make it factually correct, only then action was taken to have it removed on the basis of being a \"\"non-notable\"\" and a \"\"vanity\"\" article.  In the years since that initial experience, nothing I've experienced has done anything to contradict my distaste with the bullying, authoritarian culture within Wikipedia, and serves to confirm my suspicions about the sort of society Randroids like Jimbo would like to foist on us.  It is, however, telling that the worst punishment Wikipedia's brownshirt enforcers can think to enforce upon me is to prevent me from contributing to their project.  If I was a troll and an agent provocateur, clearly I wouldn't care and, in any case, could easily create more accounts.  I know several people who do just that.  It's obvious that the people who want so desperately to silence me and my unthinkable criticism of the wildly dysfunctional culture within Wikipedia don't really think I'm a troll or a sock puppeteer or whatever other excuses they've dragged up for silencing me; it's that I infuriatingly refuse to consider it some kind of glorious reward to give free labour to Wikipedia.\n",

      "It's an odd situation, to be forcefully barred from rowing the oars on a sinking ship, for the apparently inexcusable crime of noting that the ship is sinking.  Even now, I suspect that this final commentary will be removed, because the presence of discordant voices inside the echo chamber of Wikipedia is intolerable, even when those voices are trying to draw attention to a problem which will ultimately destroy the very community which is providing the milieu in which the echo chamber ostensibly exists to protect.  Some of the people involved clearly have a long and well-documented history of cognitive distortions which leave them largely unable to either control or be held morally culpable for their actions.  It's not these people, the sadly delusional acolytes of Jimbo, to whom I address this, but the few remaining people within Wikipedia who have closed their eyes to what's occuring.  I don't have any desire to be re-chained to the oars, so this isn't about shaming anyone into overturning the decision of the kangaroo court which silenced me on Wikipedia.  This is about getting the more-or-less sane people to feel some sense of personal responsibility for refusing to either make the attempt to stand up to the bullies or remove themselves from the culture which fosters and supports the bullies.\n",

      " I am completely convinced now! You are most certainly a paid propagandist who's sole goal on wikipedia is the integral protection of Yugoslavs and Yugoslav historiography. Hilariously enough, one needs to spend years studying the complexity of NDH in order to get the correct picture - what you do not have and will never have because of your balkan irrationality and politically fueled interest in such a topic and the surrounding topics. I really do wish I had the time and energy to flip this all around, site sources - and become more familiar with wikipedia itself - but I do not. I have trumped you in almost every single section of argument - point for point. But you still continue and you have even removed things that I have written on discussion pages within long periods of time where I am not visibly present. I would probably do the same if someone like myself was embarrassing me intellectually in the way that I embarrass you. Stipe Mesic used NDH rhetoric several times in several countries to benefit his and the HDZ's political platform. If you are going to sit here and say that the memory of NDH had nothing to do with the creation of the modern Croatian state - well then you're lying to yourself and everyone else. The entire political emigration was founded upon the tradition of NDH. The modern wave of Croatian nationalism was the idea of national reconciliation between sons of Ustase and Partizani. That's in HDZ's original political platform. Tudman had to appeal to all Croatians - that's why you Tito lovers got to parade around with the false idea of antifascism at a time when the Croatian lobby couldn't combat 60 years of communist propaganda and the Serb wartime propaganda machine that was screaming - Tudman = Pavelic, look at the flag, look at the currency! I personally witnessed Stipe Mesic playing the NDH card. He is an opportunist. He was even caught singing \"\"Jure i Boban\"\". Coincidence ?  Of course not. It was to his political benefit. He also left Tudman's side to shake hands with Croatia's political right in their smear campaign against Tudman himself. That's right, Stipe Mesic at HSP rallies years before Anto Djapic and the HSP denounced the Ustasa Movement or Dr. Pavelic. Look at Djapic now... There's another great example. 15 years ago he was Ustasa number one. In recent years, European pressure has made it unfavorable - so now he sings a different tune. That's the best part. All these people are the biggest balkan chameleons who use these catch themes to fool all the little balkanites into ignoring real problems in the country. That is how NDH is relevant. However, your side has done so well in the creation of this so-called antifascism, that 'pro-NDHers' if you will can only 'fight back' by pointing out communist crimes. Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg isn't really Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg, its Ustasa historiography Vs Partizan historiography. Most people in Croatia sympathize with one side or the other - you know that, and I know that. You can sit here and throw out fallacies, fact is fact, Stipe Mesic at one point in time glorified the tenth of April and sang Ustasa songs. That is a fact. Dr. Pavelic was allied with the Axis, that is a fact. He later in his emigre days distanced himself and his movement from the Nazis and formed a Croatian Democratic movement (HOP). They're politicians !   \"\n",

      " Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.\n",
      " I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... \"\"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons.\"\" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.\n",
      " Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of \"\"keep off MY article\"\" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )\"\n",

      "The false prophet, the navi sheker, the \"\"madman\"\" Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: \"\"These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.\"\" \n",
      "Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as \"\"a prophet from the midst of thee.\"\" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. \n",
      "Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - \"\"altering\"\" the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this \"\"imitation\"\" and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: \"\"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.\"\" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.\"\" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. \n",
      "The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive \"\"from the midst of thee\"\" is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God.

But I believe he should give his campaign a rest; it is highly disruptive and we all have better things to do.Yes, dashes vs hyphens carry important meanings for readers, and are a long-established part of the language. It is yet more important since readers see our text on electronic monitors; often, they are not of the best resolution, and no one sees it as well as on paper in good light. Hyphens can look like dots or smudges in many circumstances. This might be OK for when a hyphen is correct, but when a dash is prescribed by many of the most prestigious authorities in the US, the UK and elswhere, it is professional to use it.This debate needs to be at MoS talk, not here.

Therefore Glaucus went to a sorceress, Circe and asked for Scylla’s heart to be softened. Circe however fell in love with Glaucus who rejected her. Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it.\n",
      "What makes it a Good Story?\n",
      "The story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.\n",

This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked.

It could be translated as \"\"big soup,\"\" but that is perhaps too literal.  In any case, saying that it means \"\"big soup\"\" does not aid understanding, but rather confuses.  Why is it big?  Is it made in large quantities?  Are the vegetables big?  And so on.  It is sufficient to say that minestra means soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.\n",
      "Under Etymology, I made changes to improve conciseness.  It is not necessary to cite every etymologically related word (i.e., \"\"minister\"\" and \"\"minus\"\"); in fact, doing so clearly caused confusion since an editor in the History section of this article refers the reader to the Etymology section for the 14th c. appearance of minestrone.  Quite apart from being OR (that's another copy-edit) it is incorrect; the 14th c. is when the verb \"\"to minister\"\" appeared in English.  It has nothing whatever to do with vegetable soup except for deriving ultimately from the same Latin root.   \"\n",

      "To fully understand the nature of Limbaugh's comments, full context of the entire conversation must be included in the article. On the September 26, 2007, radio broadcast of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh received telephone calls from two listeners regarding the Iraq War. The first caller, \"\"Mike in Chicago\"\", who identified himself as a Republican and former service member, told Limbaugh, \"\"I do believe that we should pull out of Iraq.\"\" Limbaugh argued with the caller and ended up treating him dismissively.  After that call, Limbaugh next spoke to a listener who wanted to \"\"retort to Mike in Chicago\"\" (the original caller).  This second caller, who identified himself as a soldier,  complained that the media never talked to \"\"real soldiers\"\" like himself.  He was clearly responding directly to the first caller, who had told Limbaugh he felt the Iraq War was a mistake.  The current version of the article only contains the conversation with the second caller.  It doesn't make it clear that the second caller's remarks are in response to \"\"Mike in Chicago\"\"'s anti-war comments.  This second caller never mentioned Jesse Macbeth at all.  With the addition of the first conversation, the New York Times response that Limbaugh's \"\"phony soldiers\"\" comment was \"\"referring to Iraq war veterans critical of the war\"\" makes sense.  As is, this article is heavily skewed in favor of Limbaugh.  Both sides of the controversy need to be presented.  Right now, this article is simply a Limbaugh-fanatic's wet dream.- \"\n",

If administrators are instructed to remove it, they remove it and stop using it.  I can't go looking through the articles and remove it (if I can, I have no idea how).

If you cannot produce the source, then it's pretty clear you are engaging in improper original research, because you're argument boils down to 'look at the sign they carried in the opening ceremony' or 'look at the title on the IOC webpage', which is of course utter intellectual garbage if it contradicts things like the BOA's own explicit statement that Team GB is the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team. I've no issue with you using IOC usage as the basis of a Manual of Style for various tables/articles etc, but in the places that specifically talk about the team name, or where the use of the BOA's own terminolology is relevant, but where you've been busily rewriting facts and removing sources you apparently just don't like, this is unnacceptable.   \"\n",

      " The Pit and the Pendulum is a 1961 horror film directed by Roger Corman, starring  Vincent Price, Barbara Steele, John Kerr, and Luana Anders.  The screenplay by Richard Matheson was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. Set in 16th century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by  American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's  House of Usher released the previous year. A critical and box office hit, Pit's commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers. Stephen King has described one of Pit's major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film. (more...) \"\n",

      "\"Shuki: Well I am glad to see that you are up to speed on everything Wikipedian! Here are some of my reactions to your comments: UserPZFUN says that he is an admin on his user page (which I did look at before the critique), see: Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/PZFUN. Is that a lie? Nowhere do I accuse him of anti-Semitism (I see that you enjoy twisting around words...hmmm, what a pity.) While User:PZFUN may well be a lover of Jews, that does not mean that he gets a \"\"free pass\"\" when he does a weird thing to an article about a well-known rabbi. You may not know it or accept it, but the word \"\"goy\"\" or \"\"goyim\"\" is considered to be derogatory regardless of what you tell your non-Jewish pals in chat rooms (again more habitual word-twisting on your part I guess.) What's \"\"NOR\"\"? I cannot read your mind. I don't accept any of your thinking about how to handle articles that we know nothing about. I suggest, when in doubt stay away, or else violate the age old saying that \"\"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread\"\". (In Hebrew it's more blunt: hedyot kofetz berosh.) Your statemnt that: \"\"Again, baruch hashem, others Jews aren't selfish and don't ignore the rest of WP, and baruch hashem, many goyim think the same way and contribute to Jewish articles, especially w/r to structure, format, etc...\"\" is hilarious and beyond the scope of this discussion. This is Wikipedi and ANYONE can edit, do you think I don't know that? So your musar, yet again, is quite amusing. I welcome constructive criticism, but do know that I am often quite frank and honest, as most people who have gone head-to-head with me know. Finally thanks for asking me out, but lately I have been into freshly boiled kosher chicken soup more than falafel, so you are welcome to try mine any time.

I never used the term \"\"anti-vax\"\" term as it is perjorative (new word for me, but just the one I've been looking for), and for that reason you wont find anyone who is anti-vax describing themselves as such. It has always been thus, eg this 1895 book by Hutton \"\"Anyone who adopts the cause of the \"\"anti-vaccinator\"\" is, ipso facto, reckoned by a vast number of people—who on any other subject would judge fairly and patiently—a crank, a faddist, and a fool.\"\"  You can see this in front of your eyes by reading the page Midgley has created. You can see his intent by the way the more suitable and non-emotive term Vaccine Critics was deleted for this page.  He may believe sincerley that anti-vax are psychotic, but that doesn't make it OK. Also anti-vax are a small section of vaccine critics, so he is effectively deleting 90% of vaccine criticism.  And to get an idea about the term, I would have to ask people if they were happy to be termed \"\"anti-vax\"\", as I wouldn't list them as such otherwise.  15:37, 10\"\n",
