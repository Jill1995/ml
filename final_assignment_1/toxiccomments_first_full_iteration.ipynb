Unsurprisingly (as it's a Japanese-language magazine) it shows no article titled \"\"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time\"\".

Please learn to read other users' comments more carefully. And while you're at it, please stop following me, as your closely reading a comment on my talk page addressed to another user indicates you were. As for the first half of your post  the reason I am interested in your edits is because in the last five months you have made requests on ANI for me to be de fact SBANned no less than three times, and on at least two of these occasions you have justified this by claiming that the number of pages you managed to sneak past the GA review process exceeds the number of GAs I have produced. Your making bad article edits usedn't be that big a concern for me, except where you directly revert my good article edits. But once you started using the number of GA reviewers you have managed to trick into thinking you didn't misquote sources as justification for trying to get me blocked/banned, I suddenly had a massive incentive to bring to light the fact that the so-called GAs you advertise on your user page all contain serious sourcing errors.\n",

So, my question is, is this reconstruction correct in this regard? Tyrannosaurids having longer leg bones that Allosauroids and Spinosaurids (and the latter having a lower profile that other theropods) is pretty common knowledge, and longer leg bones mean more height, but, still, the mounted skeleton of Sue is not that much taller that mounted Giganotosaurus, if I recall correctly, and the mount of Spinosaurus is quite massive...\n",

      "As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian's history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand's book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not. What should not happen is the application of a double-standard.\n",

As to the flynn effect, it has been surmised by others that the I.Q. increases are due to better nutrition.  People today are much taller than they were a hundred years ago and have a larger brain size.  This change is solely due to better nutrition.  It has been shown in many studies the nutritional deficienciess can lower I.Q..  However, having a higher i.q. means that you can get better nutrition for your child and thus add even more i.q. points.  So africa's average I.Q. of around 70 is lower than it's potential as evidenced by american blacks who have an I.Q. of about 85.  However this is probably the upper limit as to what african blacks could achieve since there is significant white admixture in american black populations.  Studies of adopted children have shown that asian children tend to have I.Q.'s significantly greater than their adoptive parents (110)  while black children have I.Q.'s that are lower than their adoptive parents (90).  So evidence points to the I.Q. gap being at least partially genetic.\n",

For instance, in British Columbia and Alberta, Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) still exist. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Yukon,and N.W.T standards are slightly higher and are based on quackery-based charlatan British Chiropodists who insist on calling themselves \"\"Podiatrists\"\". In Manitoba, for example, about 15 or so quack Chiropodists insist on titling themselves \"\"Dr.\"\" despite having bogus (3-4 year) qualifications. This disgusting Manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between British Chiropodists and USA DPM's. In the province of Ontario, MAJOR differences in scope of practice exist. Consequently, there is still a title distinction between UK chiropodists and USA DPM podiatrists ( ie. American Doctors of Podiatric Medicine). Unfortunately, both share a governing body, the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. To accelerate Ontarians into confusing U.S. trained podiatrists with bogus UK \"\"podiatrists\"\", the British Chiropodists who are in greater number, heavily lobby the provincial Government regularly into perpetuating & maintaining the banned prefix \"\"Dr.\"\" and the associated title \"\"podiatrist\"\". Unbelievably, and quite maliciously, British Chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all USA DPM's who migrate after 1993 into accepting and only using the title chiropodist. This is plainly maliciously designed so that the Ontarian public cannot distinguish the vast difference in educational qualifications.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.

It is not called List of people that claim or claimed to be God.  My contention is that the article needs to narrow its scope to become useful. For example, in Sikhism, (and Andries is correct in regard of non-idolatry), their gurus are considered to be of divine providence (see the halos behind any Sikh guru portrait...).  For example if we call this article, \"\"List of people that claim or claimed to be the Creator\"\", it will be an appropriate distinction. When we say \"\"deity\"\", then the scope is too wide resulting in an article that does not provide any encyclopedic value IMO, and one that looks like better beloning in a tabloid...  \"\n",

Experimental type Techno obviously deserves a place in the history, but as far as dance records, It was modelled hugely after what Ron Hardy was playing in the Music Box. The output of labels such as Trax, DJ International, and Jack Trax was monstrous in comparison to the small industrial wasteland scene of Detroit at the time, along with it the labels that were releasing \"\"Techno\"\" - Metroplex, KMS etc. This large volume of output in Chicago is what was filling the gap.  \"\n",

This I do not accept: I know it is used by some BrE speakers but others, including me, find it archaic and frankly embarrassing.

      "Northern Ireland (, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland[2]...\n",
      "\n",
      "2 In common with the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is sometimes referred to as a \"\"country\"\" (example). The UK government also refers specifically to Northern Ireland as being a \"\"province\"\" (UK: example; NI: example) or a \"\"region\"\" (UK: example; NI: example). Regardless of the choice of term, it is likely to be unsatisfactory and can imply a preferred political perspective:\n",
      " \"\"One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government.\"\" - J. Whyte and G. FitzGerald, 1991, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press: Oxford\n",
      " \"\"One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change.\"\" - S. Dunn and H. Dawson, 2000, An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Edwin Mellen Press: Lampeter\n",
      " \"\"Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'.\"\" - D. Murphy, 1979, A Place Apart, Penguin Books: London and it is situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, its population was 1,685,000, constituting between a quarter and a third of the island's total population and about 3% of the population of the United Kingdom.\n",

Otherwise, the enemies of socialism in one country blah-blah-blah... There were, after all, examples were the workers' movement was set back twenty years because of bad timing, provocation and over-eagerness, and there have been voices trying to insinuate that the workers' state and the international workers' movement are not walking side by side on the path of socialism, but rather accomplices in an imperialist plot.

      "...I like to chip in sometimes with a helpful comment, but please don't take that as meaning that I totally agree with your recent stance on Wikipedia matters. Sure, there are some trigger-happy people about, and new editors should be treated with every consideration; but to me this doesn't mean we accept any self-publicity, trivia or opinionated diatribes they care to post. This is meant to be an encyclopedia, not like social media websites where they eagerly accept any & all user-generated content. So it may appear \"\"hostile\"\" to those whose expectations are formed in using those other websites. To reduce the chances that a new user will have a bad experience, it would be better to argue for measures to let them know, before they post their contributions, that we do in fact have limits to what we accept and do demand scads of references. That, and educating new page patrollers and restricting new or clueless users from doing patrolling. Sorry, yes, limits and restrictions, and not because we're loveless police but because restrictions and limits are necessary to maintain our project as a usable, credible and valuable resource for the world's readers.

The problem is, while there are examples of androcentricity in language (although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable), the examples she cites are not, and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with \"\"natural\"\" gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language. She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft. It's pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics (or in the languages she has attempted to analyze), and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language. Or perhaps she had, but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions? In any case, it's fairly obvious why the original version of the book was not published by an academic press, and why the revised second version is self-published.   \n",

      " Talk of scientific principles is pseudoscience which was discarded in the Renaissance.  Modern science is essentially empirical - it makes experiments and observations.  Theories and principles are secondary and must follow these results whither they lead, whether they make sense or not.  In medicine, simple mechanistic ideas do not suffice to explain many observations.  For example, if you give someone an emetic in a certain way then it is found to have the opposite effect of preventing nausea.  It seems that the doctor-patient relationship plays a considerable part in this and it may be that homeopathy is especially efficacious in this regard.

      "Hello, Wood Dickinson. I will try to clarify a few issues. I hope doing so will be helpful to you. You have presumably seen the deletion log entry, otherwise you would not have known that I deleted the article. You will therefore have seen that the reason I deleted it was logged as \"\"Article that has no meaningful, substantive content\"\". Indeed, the full and complete text that you posted was \"\"Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas. Developing entry for this film. I wrote it and produced as well. Wood Dickinson reference\"\" followed by a URL. The deletion had nothing to do with copyright, nor did it indicate that I \"\"don't see any value\"\" in having an article on the subject. The only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago. I expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject. Wikipedia does not have \"\"placeholder\"\" articles waiting for content to be added, as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of Wikipedia, and a web page that says words to the effect \"\"we haven't written this page yet, but we will\"\" does not produce a good impression. Instead, if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication, we keep it in a \"\"userspace\"\" page: for example, if I were to write an article on that subject then I could create a page called User:JamesBWatson/Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, and move it to Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas when it was ready.\n",

      "\n",
      "I understand that some members have a politically motivated desire to make the 2010 election look as sinister and anti-democratic  as possible, but you have to get the facts straight about these four sources on “40,000 protesters”.1. This one shouldn't be considered altogether. It is a UNHCR page quoting instead of a reliable news source a Washington-based “foundation” whose purpose is: “to inform and educate policy makers and the broader policy community about events and trends in those societies which are strategically or tactically important to the United States and which frequently restrict access to such information.” . It is a politically biased organization, not an independent news source. So, out with it!2. These two ,  are respectively the Voice of America and MSNBC (not MSNBC really but a direct quote from Bloomberg here). So in reality it is VoA and Bloomberg. Well, let me inform you that we are talking about the same guy - his name is James Brooke, as anyone can plainly see since 2006 he has been stationed in Moscow to report for Bloomberg and as of last summer for the VoA as well. Leaving aside the fact that the VoA is more of a propaganda tool fully owned by US government rather than an independent news source, let's see how Mr. Brooke came about this magic number - “40,000”. Apparently he was there, but did he count the demonstrators himself? No, he quotes Associated Press: “Within an hour, the Associated Press was estimating the turnout at 40,000.”!  Well, it wasn't. Anyone can see the number of AP and that number is 10,000. A little white lie, Mr. Brooke. Or maybe I'm too harsh, maybe AP did broadcast that number intially, but then seeing how preposterous it was quickly brought it down to what all the other major media guys were reporting. In any event, this “40,000 people” thing doesn't hold water.3. Basically the same goes for CBC as well. As I already said in one of the comments not only CBC didn't have its own staff in Minsk that night (I checked this myself here in Toronto with CBC Headquarters), anyone can see how heavily in that article it relied on other media: “Reuters reported...The Associated Press reported...”. As we know already from these ,  quotes both Reuters and Associated Press mentioned 10,000 protesters each.\n",

He then went travelling in 1926/1928 to London, Berlin, Paris and back to London. Also, when Francis was born in Ireland under British rule he would be British by his passport and then he would be automatically Irish by 1922  and could later reclaim his British nationality  which there is no evidence that he did. So he's irish until proven otherwise. Further to that it threatens the credibility of Wikipedia if a survey of people decide he is British because they think so. Someone's nationality cannot decided by concensus which is whats happening here.

      " I encourage you to read that essay carefully. WP is a great resource. It is an amazing resource. It is additionally useful, helpful, unprecedented, and perhaps even world changing! I love it, that's why I volunteer my time here to improve articles and direct people to resources that can help answer their questions. But none of that makes it reliable, not in WP's own terminology. The scientific theory article is a great example. That's actually a pretty good article. And it's useful for many purposes. But the definition is presented too simplistically, and it makes it seem that all theories are generally accepted as true explanations of the world, and that is not the case, as is demonstrated by the phlogiston theory. And that example is confusing, but there are also many many inaccuracies and outright incorrect statements on WP  I know because I've fixed a few. Some are accidental, some are malicious, some will be soon fixed, but others linger. Another thing to remember is WP is always a work in progress. A true scholar should evaluate the reliability of every source. That is why I keep directing you to the SEP. That article is written by highly esteemed professional philosophers of science, who we know are educated, trained, credentialed and accepted in that community. Likewise, textbooks are vetted by editors and publishers, and academic journal articles go through peer review to help ensure that correct information is presented. That is part of why they are WP:RS. In contrast, WP is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. I can assert to you that I'm a professional scientist, with over a hundred citations in peer-reviewed journals to my academic articles, and a PhD in math, and maybe that will help convince you that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to prove that to you, and you can't really be sure that I'm not making that stuff up ) While we attempt to distill our reliable sources into good articles, sometimes that gets messed up. If you read the entirety of the SEP article on scientific theory, you will see that it does not support the sentence which cites it in our article! I don't know how that happened. But it will just sit there wrong until someone notices and has the time and energy to fix it. And even then, some well-intentioned editors may resist the change, and revert. And maybe it's not even wrong. Maybe some RS do reserve \"\"theory\"\" for widely accepted theories, and would instead say that we should rename the Phlogiston theory to \"\"the former Phlogiston theory\"\" or something else! So then we'd have to do a whole re-write, explaining several different notions of what a scientific theory is, and then it might make the article less useful for the casual reader. \n",
      "For 99% of lay use, the issue of reliability may not matter. And surely using WP's sources to cite in papers is a great idea - but you have to make sure that you read and understand them yourself, and don't depend on what WP says they say. If my life depended on it, I would not trust anything on WP, unless somehow I had no other sources available at all, and hence no choice. So no, WP is not reliable.

      "\"\"Some anthropologists and sociologists are critical of the method because it measures personality traits on a basis of its synonymous adjectives in the English language, thus overlooking possible cultural construction of language. That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.\"\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"\"Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later\n",

      "As a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's \"\"likely true of most subordinated individuals\"\" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research \"\"reinforces stereotypes\"\" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct.

The idea was that since Masons were said to have played an important part in the founding of the Republic, the education system should allow a good deal of space for Masonic public educators. The educators were known as the Black Knights (Hussards noirs) because  their particular attire and devotion to secularist values. Conversely, all Catholic involvement in the education system was restricted or forbidden because of its seemingly religious character. This issue was for a long time at the forefront of difficult Church-State relations on the continent, and better access to private education was only granted in the 1980s after a long period of domination by the public sector. There were also similar issues in Mexico after the signing of the 1917 constitution.\n",

Clearly, the policy change from using to not using a colon was therefore initiated with the release of Star Trek Generations and Wikipedia should reflect this. Another consideration is that if the title of this article \"\"Star Trek Into Darkness\"\" is going to stay this way (which, btw, I support and find sensible), there will be an inconsistency in the titling of movie articles, because one article (this one) would use the titling as in the official source, whereas the other(s) would use titling according to Wikipedian style rules.

But then Hutchinson, who's really active on that forum, basically said it was just a way for them to write more 78-98 set stories without screwing up the timeline.  He's very vocal in his dislike for the Thornverse.  You're probably right, I wonder what Michael stood to gain from covering up his crime.  Btw, the TPB of Nightdance is going to have an extra story about Charlie Bowles, the Russelville hacksaw killer mentioned in the first film.

First, the relevant article was only published 4 days ago, and so it is too recent for the rest of the academic community to have chewed it over and responded in any way. The articles in Wikipedia are not random newsfeeds of the latest events in each topic, but are encyclopedic summaries based mainly on secondary sources, that give a balanced overview of their subject. Primary research sources published in the last few days rarely make an article, and should never be used at the end of a section implying that they may represent the 'last word' on a subtopic. Secondly, the abstract of the referenced paper actually says that, by setting experimental subjects \"\"“science comprehension” tests\"\", that it has detected \"\"the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition\"\". This is a long way from the much more even-handed coverage that Vgy7ujm gave it, by saying \"\"that global warming skeptics are as familiar with the relevant science as their opponents. They simply arrive at different conclusions.\"\" - as if this gives their antiscience views equal validity.

Almost no one is familiar with the name Acer floridanum, and despite the fact that recent publications suggest that Acer floridanum might be preferable (the conclusion of that paper wasn't entirely confident as I recall), it's a bit premature to be moving it. Aside from the one publication in a relatively unimportant botanical journal, there isn't much supporting the name. It's not considered accepted by the vast majority of sources (including ITIS, which I think is our standard). Besides, the taxonomy of the species is simply too volatile to be moving it around. DNA work could reveal tomorrow that it's a variety of sugar maple. It's best to wait until a name is more or less universally accepted.

      "Babylon has set up a system designed to keep black people enslaved and ashamed of their culture. The system is so structured that the only way for black people, is to look to the east and seek repatriation to the continent of their origin guided by the Trinity of Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey and Immanuel and thier teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      " This is the message of Sizzla and it influences his music to the extent that he is being looked upon as the teacher and the inspiration for Jamaican youths who want to retain the basic culture of their African origins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sizzla's songs speak to poverty and hopelessness that pervades young Jamaica and obviously oppressed youths worldwide. Like Bob Marley, a couple of generations before him, he delivers a message which speaks to poverty, homelessness, police brutality, cultural pride and political and religious oppression.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Born Miguel Collins,  Sizzla is a product of one of Jamaica's uptown ghettos, August Town.\n",
      "\n",
      "        One of his earliest experiences of how unfair the social system is in Jamaica, was while he was in his mid-teens. In order to get into a Technical High School so he could learn a trade and have a better chance of earning a living, he had to leave High School , go back to pre-high and then apply to get into a High School which taught trades- Dunoon High School, where he studied Mechanical Engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Dunoon has a reputation of association with some of the best dancehall deejays from the city, including Shabba Ranks and Lady G. So with an inner inclination towards music, it wasn't surprising that while there, he started recording music.\n",
      "\n",
      "        It was Homer Harris, the same man who gave Buju Banton his first break, who introduced him to top Jamaican saxophonist, Dean Frazier, (Musical Director for Philip \"\"Fattis\"\" Burrell's Xterminator Family).\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"\"Fatis\"\" was delighted with his potential, decided to record him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sizzla, who had originally planned to follow in the footsteps of his mechanic father Aston, suddenly had a change of heart. He abandoned his mechanic training, came under the influence of Buju Banton and Shabba Ranks' cassettes and decided to stick to music.\n",
      "\n",
      "        The auto industry loss was a tremendous gain for the music industry in Jamaica and indeed around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Since the start of 1997, Sizzla's popularity within the music industry has grown so rapidly, he is considered a musical phenomenon. His tunes fill the charts and sales have been so trmrndous that every reggae producer wished he had a Sizzla song to release and every sound system wants a Sizzla dubplate to be current.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Touring with the Xterminator Family and star perfomer Luciano, has gained for him, tremendous experience and exposure and now Sizzla is about to move up the ranks and make his name as a musical prophet and messenger, in his own right\"\n",

      " Dear Michael, thanks for your reply. Once you introduce torsion, there is this critical uncertainty about what the \"\"minimal coupling\"\" means. The coupling that decouples the torsion altogether always has to be allowed - and it's probably the right one. There are various other fundamental problems - that it's not really clear what the theory should be to describe the real world. Even if you want to couple Einstein-Cartan theory to ordinary electromagnetism, there exists no candidate for a \"\"minimal coupling\"\". Moreover, the newer, more well-defined versions of the Einstein-Cartan theory, e.g. due to Stelle and West (involving non-commutativity as a justification), actually predict big enough phenomena and can be falsified. For both claims, see e.g. the 2009 paper by Gibbons et al.  (the falsification is described in the comment about 1,000 seconds; Gibbons is a senior guy who wrote important papers with Hawking and others). I think it's valid to say that any concrete enough version of the theory - including couplings to known types of matter - can be falsified and has been falsified. So the concept is only surviving as a vague one, with a wishful thinking that there could still exist a viable version of it. But no such version is known - at least not a natural one. What's really missing is the motivation. In string theory, one can see that there's no torsion, perhaps except for the H-field (a 3-form) but the H-field doesn't have the usual normal properties of the Einstein-Cartan torsion field. In fact, in 4D, the H-field may be Hodge dualized to a scalar, the universal axion, and such fields are naturally massive - otherwise new long-range forces would have to exist but they don't. If they were not massive, you would really modify the GR even at long distances, and created new polarizations of gravitational waves, altered the prediction for gravitational lensing, and other things. All these things are absent according to observations as well as string theory. Moreover, the very idea about the \"\"minimality\"\" of the couplings has been changed in the 1970s by the insights of the renormalization group. We no longer prefer \"\"simple\"\" couplings because they look aesthetically and subjectively simple but because we can technically prove that these couplings - and low-derivative terms - prevail at long distances. This modern kind of reasoning leaves no natural room for torsion. So  all the motivation is just historical in character and can't be reconciled with the modern way of organizing fields and terms in field theory, and the people who defend it don't understand the last 60 years in theoretical physics.   \"\n",

      "Well, now I see why I missed your comment the first time...it wasn't even on my talkpage; I read it on someone else's talkpage (Broxton's) and got confused, haha.  But anyway, yeah.  To give a good example of a \"\"cup of coffee\"\" MLS transaction, let me go back to Toronto's actions in the expansion draft of 2006.  In expansion drafts, clubs have the option to \"\"protect\"\" a certain number of players while leaving others \"\"unprotected\"\".  Unprotected players can be drafted at will by the expansion franchise (Toronto in this example), who can take one from each team.  One of the league's clubs, Real Salt Lake, made a strategic gamble that they could leave one of their key/totemic players, Jason Kreis (now their manager), unprotected.  They assumed that TFC would want nothing to do with an aging player whose oversized salary would be a big hit on their cap.  Seeing an opportunity, Mo Johnston at TFC took Kreis from RSL in the draft...not because he actually wanted Kreis, but because he knew that RSL still needed him.  By doing this, TFC was able to briefly hold Kreis hostage until RSL agreed to trade something else of value to get Kreis back.  So, Kreis was briefly a TFC player, but only because he became a pawn in larger machinations.  Because of instances like this, which are common enough throughout league history, we seem to have a consensus to disregard in-and-out situations during the offseason.\n",
      "And for a bit of further detail — not relevant to Atieno and USL players but important as a point of reference for many other US-based players — it should be noted that MLS has a single-entity corporate structure, and that technically all players are contracted by the league itself, not by individual teams.  This means that all listings of player tenures with MLS teams are de facto in the first place, and that gives us a bit of leeway in striking out certain unimportant and very temporary tenures, as in the example given.  Hope that helps. ''' 《Defender of Open Editing》''' \"\n",

      "Well, it does have some issues, so it seems.   First, I moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by NewsMax as a GOP figure.  I placed that to the other section about criticism and praise.  But, now there's just these two other sentences.   And they're really just dealing with her public appearances, which we've considered before… in fact, we eliminated them a while ago, if you see prior notes. See this Talk Page, where we mention that prior section once called \"\"Through all this time, Fiorina has appeared…\"\"  Remember that? We questioned the paragraph(s) and their citations and relevance.  Eventually it was eliminated. That's probably becasuse she's not unlike most public figures, that make many, many appearances through their lifetime.  That section has been gone a while now, seemingly without objection.  I'm guessing that's because most of us have agreed that we're not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made.  If its significant or exceptional, surely we can mention it.  But, now however, I'm wondering about a very short section that's currently titled Advocate at large.  That's since its become whittled down to two sentences, one of which is questionable.  I've actually found she may have appeared at Ripon several times.  But, to play devil's advocate… So what?  Republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups, Democrats before liberal groups, Greens before their own…. and so on.  Therefore, I question how exceptional this should be regarded.  By the way second sentence mentions \"\"National Press Club\"\" as mentioned in the article.  But this Wikipedia article is attributing that to a Press club although it reads as \"\"National Press Club.\"\"  It's not particular to National Press Club (United States), which I'm not quick to assume, since the disambiguation the source (named in the citation) ambiguously calls it \"\"the National Press Club.\"\"  Again… appearing before THE National Press Club of the U.S. is not all that exceptional.  They invite notable dignitaries all the time… whoever, whatever party… etc.  Again, so what?   I wouldn't be surprised if The Club has invited most of the presidential candidates, if not had some of them speak in prior events, before they became candidates. So, I'm almost at the point of wanting to eliminate this entire section.  Any comments?   \"\n",

      "Hi Edgar. Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   \n",
      "The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181) \n",
      "Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   \n",
      "Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds\n",

That does not inspire confidence in your detective skills. Giano has, in the past, attempted to remove himself from the project by scrambling his password; and then decided to return. For Giano, it was considered more appropriate to do it under a new username rather than request a new password (Giano is not the most computer savvy of editors - he rather concentrates on the content than the means of placing it upon the page). Furthermore, very likely the vast majority of established editors are fully aware of who Giano is - and his previous accounts. WP:Alternate accounts does allow people to have different accounts, and even allows them to be used at the same time (but not in the same places, usually) - it is the undisclosed use of multiple accounts, designed to circumvent Wikipedia policy, that is not permitted. I suggest that, when you start digging for information, you make yourself familiar with all aspects of a matter, otherwise you may find that the result of your excavating is that you are simply in a deep and dark hole.

I wouldn't have an issue with it if it said \"\"notable volcanoes of the Cascade Volcanic Belt\"\" or Cascade whatever-it-is: it's not the Cascade Range.  I haven't looked at the edit history to see if you placed this; could have been a statesider for all I know; but unless the Cascades template is reworded in its titling and doesn't focus on the \"\"High Cascades\"\" volcanoes, it's not suitable for a Canadian volcano, even Garibaldi (which Americans continue to think is in the Cascades, as if none of the rest of the Coast Mountains were and it weren't on the far side of the Fraser.  Don't mean to be snippy, I'm just very particular about definitions; and even more particular about fuzzification of them.  Is the template from the Cascade Range bunch, or from the WikiProject Mountains, do you know?  If it's the latter I'll take it up with them in the forum there....BTW I found a really amazing couple of shots of the top of Meager, maybe it's Plinth or Devastator I'm not sure; google \"\"Randall and Kat's Flying Photos\"\" and tour the first flight, the 2006 one to Chilko Lake.   \"\n",

They are both done in later times to represent an historical figure.  Muslims do have a tradition of representing the prophet in images even if it is not the most prevalent.  What the image on the page represents is part of the tradition that Muslims have in representing Muhammad.  Now, feel free to enter into discussion about whether or not you believe such images are important enough to warrant inclusion on Muhammad but make sure you are arguing about depictions in Muslim tradition and not merely your own personal feelings.  Also note that Depictions of Muhammad (AVOID if you will be offended) has various images of MuhammadMuslim and non-Muslim over time.  Because Wikipedia is not censored it will remain no matter how insulting the images are to many people.

Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.  What I do not do is nominate pages that I think cover worthwhile topics for AfD as a way of bullying the editors whose edits I do not like.\n",

      "Snivelling will get you no where. And please do review the burden of proof principle. Obviously, the authors of this Wiki found a list of Christians who think Jesus is real, and one Atheist (Ehrman). Now it's been compiled into a ridiculous paragraph, as  mentioned, and spread to every Jesus article. Statements from historians like Richard Carrier, or as   your ilk prefer to call him, \"\"blogger\"\" are routinely removed from this article as are statements from Ehrman which are critical of historical Jesus claims regarding what is and isn't accepted as historical. So, just because you've compiled a short paragraph,   with a few pastors and priests who think Jesus was real, doesn't mean I have to find a paragraph that states otherwise. The point is, this article is full of that type of BS, and we don't need to disprove your claims any more than we need to disprove claims of a magic spaghetti monster, so quit with your snivelling rhetoric about personal attacks and us finding reliable sources to disprove your positive claims. The fact is, those sources, as Bash Prompt and 3 or 4 others have already indicated DO NOT BELONG. Capice? Not sure if English is your first language, Wong, but I hope you catch my drift, and if you're all butt hurt about personal attacks take it up with the board instead of whining and bitching like a snivelling child who's just been told that the tooth fairy isn't real.  \"\n",

As an Automotive Engineer, with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics, I can assure you that traction control and EDL are operate in two very different methods.  All traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the non-driven axle - any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will ONLY result in either (a) BOTH driven wheels on the same axle being braked, or (b) the engine ECU reducing engine output, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).  EDL does NOT compare differences between front and rear axles, it ONLY compares differences between the left and right wheels on the same axle, and brakes just ONE wheel, there is NO engine power intervention.  Whilst they are both \"\"add-on\"\" functions of modern ESP systems, and use the same related hardware and electronics, the software control of the two different systems are distinctly separate, and help moderate/control different aspects of vehicle dynamics.

Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of \"\"land/country and city\"\" for \"\"shahr\"\"?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name.

As the article states, there are several definitions for the capacity for a barrel (42 or 55 gallons).  I highly doubt that the US gov't is or was responsible for defining the capacity of a barrel of crude oil used for commerce (or that it is a world-wide legal requirement to use a US-gov't definition) but if there is any such legal requirement then again a reference should be stated in the main article.  To say that NYMEX has \"\"no legal right to define measurement units\"\" is a bogus argument.  What NYMEX has is the right to define or specify units that are pertinent to trade.  If NYMEX states that oil is to be traded in terms of barrels, then it is not \"\"illegal\"\" for NYMEX to state the capacity of this thing called a \"\"barrel\"\" in terms of unambiguous STANDARD units, or to point to an authoritative source (authoritative as far as NYMEX is concerned) that defines the capacity of a barrel.\n",

Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient.

Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.\"\"\n",

He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.\n",

Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, \"\"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876\"\" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science \"\"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD\"\". According to Menninger (p. 400): \"\"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land \"\"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden.\"\" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression \"\"50 wreaths of flowers\"\" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity.\"\" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, \"\"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century.\"\" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.  \n",

This origin actually resembles the first more than the second.  This makes it likely that he is from Earth-22, like the superman in JSA.  It is common for the new 52 Earths to resemble previous DC comic's Elseworlds, but have some differences.  It has already been shown that Earth-22 resembles Kingdom Come, but has some slight differences.  This explains the Kansas destruction being the same, but the change in his power source being from quintessence to a Third World god. Although time will tell if this is right, it does seem like the logical conclusion.  Someone can add this to the article when it is revealed in the pages of JSA.   \n",

It is a somewhat inflammatory word.  To many (esp. conservatives), \"\"activist\"\" is an insult.  I think \"\"activist\"\" is a fair factual description of some of Sotomayor's activities at Princeton and (to a lesser extent) at Yale, but without the context that is present later in the article, the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out, and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be (i.e. sit-ins, protests, 60s-style \"\"activism,\"\" militancy, that sort of thing).  That's not what you mean by the word in this context, but the reader won't know that before reading the full article, which is getting pretty long.  Also, it's not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway.  There's a lot of stuff in the article that's arguably more important than these particular episodes in her life (especially at Yale, where any activism really was a very small part of the story of her time there).  What do you think?  If you really wanted to keep this in the lede, perhaps the wording could be changed, e.g. \"\"She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools\"\" or something like that.

      "\"\"Democrat Party\"\" is a term used in the United States instead of \"\"Democratic Party\"\" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer \"\"they are the only true adherents of democracy.\"\"[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term \"\"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.\"\"[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only \"\"deeply committed\"\" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is \"\"trivial\"\".[2][3] [4]\n",
      "\n",
      "History of usage\n",
      "The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, \"\"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.\"\"[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled \"\"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'\"\"[7]\n",

Also from WP:NPOV “Verifiability lives alongside neutrality, it does not override it. A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.\n",

      "To Derild4921 and Sadads: If your main dispute is the sourcing with the original article then why did you not contact me, as I could have provided the additional source material - you can see from my contributions I just author Tunnels books on here. As I said above all the content of the original article is completely accurate and can be verified. I have provided a number of source links to justify that. Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to 'help' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven't yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn't merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn't \"\"about to killed\"\" under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there's no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards. My priority is not, however, achieving GA status at the expense of diminished quality or informative reading. I do have the support of the UK fansite team on this. The authors have often been kind enough to verify and supply content for my article. Following my notification about your changes, they have emailed me their confirmation that they would also like to see the original version restored. I await your response. Thanks (  )\"\n",

This has been raised on the talk page, and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources.

On a microscale nothing matters. You, me can join, can leave Wikipedia, very few would even notice. In a matter of days, may be months names and contributions would be forgotten, the project would however survive. \n",

I understand that they joined the project to help it achieve a certain goal (whatever they set in their mind) and after a failure to do so, they leave frustrated. But to claim Wikipedia is broken? Why? What do they see that I do not? To me it is akin to claiming that the nature is broken after seeing that foxes eat rabbits. What do you think about that? (  )\n",

Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential.

I have seen this picture, and the picture shown on this website is neither the same picture, nor is it a picture of the same personage. The claims that this photograph is a photograph of Baha'u'llah are false. The person in this photograph bears no physical resemblance to the personage in the photograph on display in the archives. Their ages appear to be the same, so the dissimilarity in resemblence cannot be ascribed to age differences in the same person.\n",
      "I'm going to correct the text on display claiming \"\"two pictures\"\" were taken of this historical figure, and am going to remove the picture. Quite frankly, all this debate is quite ridicules. I respect the Baha'is right to respect the Manifestations of God by not portraying their images publically, but they seem a bit too defensive. THeir all worried about showing his picture publicaly, and this isnt even his picture. Apparently this picture has been distributed, even among Baha'is. These people havent even seen the picture in the archives. I cannot emphasize how different in appearance the two personages in the two photographs are. Why do you think they never show the archives picture online? Or never show the two photographs together? Because it would be obvious that one of them is a false picture.\n",

The British government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the Seven Years War 1756–1763, the British Empire was deep in debt. To help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the Parliament of Great Britain/British Parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of British America. Previously, through the Trade and Navigation Acts, Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. However, with the Sugar Act of 1764, Parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists initially objected to the Sugar Act for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was argued that the Bill of Rights 1688 protected British subjects from being taxed without the consent of a truly representative Parliament. Because the colonies elected no members of the British Parliament, many colonists viewed Parliament's attempt to tax them as a violation of the constitutional doctrine of taxation only by consent. Some British politicians countered this argument with the theory of \"\"virtual representation\"\", which maintained that the colonists were in fact represented in Parliament even though they elected no members. This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention following Parliament's passage of the 1765 Stamp Act. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.[4] Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies \"\"in all cases whatsoever\"\".[5]\n",

      "The first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act of 1767.[6] This act represented the Chatham ministry's new approach for generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.[7] The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or \"\"internal\"\") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or \"\"external\"\") taxes, such as taxes on imports.[8] With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new duties on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.[9] These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "The British government's belief that the colonists would accept \"\"external\"\" taxes resulted from a misunderstanding of the colonial objection to the Stamp Act. The colonists' objection to \"\"internal\"\" taxes did not mean that they would accept \"\"external\"\" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.[8] \"\"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional\"\", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, \"\"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.\"\"[11] The Townshend Revenue Act received the royal assent on 29 June 1767.[12] There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. \"\"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage\"\", wrote historian Peter Thomas.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act of 1767,[13] which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.[14] The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.[15] The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad\n",

The wording also seemed apologetic which Muslim scholars would never have been regarding the actions of the prophet, they would have accepted it and used it to legislate if they deemed the source reliable. Two issues are missing in terms of context, she was calling for his assassination during a time of open warfare and she was doing it via poetry which is considered the highest form of publication among the Arabs in those times as the entire society revolved around oral tradition and poetry. Poets had a place higher than tribal leaders in that society, and where often feared as well as praised [for the good or damage they could do to a persons reputation]. To put it into a modern context this would have been the equivalent of Khomeini calling for the assassination of salman rashdi in a time of war and not the image of a little girl who writes poetry.\n",

I invite comment on whether \"\"Myth of 'Flat Earth' belief\"\" would be a better title.  ~  (talk) \n",

      "Russell calls it the “modern Flat Earth Error” or just the “Flat Error” in Inventing the Flat Earth (1991). In a 1997 conference he then refers to it as “the myth of the flat earth” (no capitals anywhere). None of these variants convey what the actual error is, and of course the reason Russell doesn’t try is that a literally accurate name would be quite long, something along the lines of “the modern misconception of a medieval European belief in a flat earth”. “Myth of a 'Flat Earth' belief” isn’t horrible, but it’s still not likely to mean anything to someone who doesn’t already know what it’s supposed to mean, in which case we haven’t achieved anything by changing. Russell’s book title works better than any of these other attempts. Something along the lines of “Flat Earth concoction” would give less chance for someone to mistake the article as a description of the belief that the earth is flat, something that has already happened twice in just the call for a capitalization change.   \n",

WP has a convention of not capitalizing such labels, even for universally accepted theories.  \"\"Modern flat earth error\"\" is a good start toward settling on a WP article title that makes sense. This article is about a modern belief about pre-modern belief in a flat earth. How do we address that most clearly? Two previously mentioned possibilities were \"\"Modern misconception of prevailing Middle Ages' belief in a flat Earth\"\" (which has a possessive usage error), and \"\"Modern misconception of prevailing belief in a flat Earth in history\"\".  I think I'd go with: '' (with precisely that capitalization; see above RM, which can and should proceed in the interim to comply with WP:MOSCAPS, since this \"\"what should this  be titled\"\" discussion could drag out for who knows how long, if it ever gets resolved).  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼  09:\"\n",

      "Cu, I do not think it's so much a matter of translation as of using different recensions. All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to \"\"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter.\"\" And \"\"hereafter\"\" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to \"\"Romanism\"\" - in fact the British invented all this \"\"Joseph of Arimathea\"\" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome. In this context I find it significant that David was made Archbishop in Jerusalem - and that this western Archbishopric has completely disappeared!   \"\n",

As the FLDS leadership continued to prophesy that the end of the world was quickly approaching, they taught the people that wickedness needed to be purged from their society. Jeffs taught, 'One or two covenant breakers can cause the Lord to stop blessing this people. As long as we have evil doers among us, the Lord's blessings will be withheld. Zion must be pure. We can't have evil people among the priesthood for the Lord to appear and bless us like He would like to. Be this a warning.' (W.S.J. 12/26/95) Jeffs laid the doctrinal groundwork to justify a cleansing of the FLDS. Their theology teaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named Enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. The FLDS believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed.\"\"[... ... \"\"Yearning for Zion,\"\" a hymn by W.S.

In 2011 the University of Canterbury slipped from 189th to 212th in these rankings.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5569146/NZ-universities-lose-ground University loses ground. As the 2011 results were released, the University of Canterbury launched an advertising campaign in which the VIce Chancellor Dr Rod Carr claims that it ranks among the top 2% of universities in the world but without elaborating on what basis this was assessed.http://www.bsec.canterbury.ac.nz/ Uni in top 2%. Further, the University has promoted itself as being the first university in New Zealand to have been granted five stars by QS Stars, a global university rating system.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5708043/Canterbury-University-gets-top-marks Canterbury University gets top marks.

      "Oh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.\n",
      "Jerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.\n",
      "And were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)\n",
      "And about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.\n",
      "And yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

I would also add that Schlesinger, as a historian of the United States, a country which has never seen viable communist or fascist movements, would seem a poor choice as a specialist to quote.

Given that the document was published well after the death of the source author (whom it is alleged borrowed from an earlier source anyway) your example isn't remotely relevant. The chain of authorship isn't as simplistic as your example. An alternative presentation of plagiarism is the Origin_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#Purported_plagiarism because of the intent of the author but oddly enough the Book_of_Mormon article doesn't mention \"\"plagiarism\"\" at all. Here it is the reverse with numerous use of wording for \"\"plagiarism\"\" and in the lead paragraphs but yet with no clear idea how the (mostly) anonymous authors would gain from the plagiarism i.e. gain from the reputation of Maurice Joly. The claim of \"\"plagiarism\"\" only works if there is an unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Now the problem for you is that Serge Nilus did plagiarise the protocols but the protocols themselves are not plagiarised but derivative. If no one claims authorship then where does that leave the claim of plagiarism ? . That's not clearly proven here so I'm suggesting that the word \"\"plagiarism\"\" is removed from the lead paragraph (though it can stay within the main text and elsewhere that the protocols are used in context of being derivative from the earlier work) as it unbalances the lead. \"\"hoax\"\" and \"\"literary forgery\"\" can obviously stay.   \"\n",

I don't think there can be any justification for including editorialising like \"\"The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play\"\" or leading statements like \"\"The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is 'science' or just 'politics', and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells' name for this taxon\"\". We can only repeat or report what the sources say. In this case, we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson (2010) concluded that Wells' publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN, and that they disputed whether \"\"W. dorsei\"\" warranted recognition as a separate species. I have seen similar cases elsewhere, with statements like \"\"this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN[1]\"\", where the citation is to the ICZN itself (which naturally doesn't mention the case in question) – this is to my mind obviously unacceptable. On less contentious issues, how many species are there in the genus? We learn that the \"\"genus currently contains five [...] species\"\", but only four are listed.

      " EESWARA CHEKAVA EZHAVAR  ( Summons everybody regarding tackling with Nair Vandals and also about SURNAMES of \"\"Ezhavar\"\" ) \n",
      "\n",
      "Dear \"\"Ezhava\"\" friends, I am a 6th Dan Black Belt in Shoto-Khan ( Karate ) and also having 2 Degrees in both Kalarippayattu (Vadakkan Style) and Shawolin Kung-fu ( Wing Chun Style ).. hailing from an Orthodox Chekava Ezhavar family in north Malabar, and also a Master in Law (M.L.M) and have been practicing in High Court . Our family is one of the reputed Chekava families in Kerala and trainers of \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" for centuries. And according to our family sayings our family was the leading \"\"Kalari\"\"(the temple for training \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\")  in kerala for training \"\"Vadakkan Style\"\" & \"\"Thekkan Style\"\". And hear that when Nairs and all came to Kerala, they were very poor and good in character and were the servants of \"\"Namboothiri-Brahmin-Caste\"\" .One thing we are very proud with to tell that, even centuries before the arrival of \"\"Brahmins\"\" & \"\"Nairs\"\" to kerala, here our ancestors had made this martial art of \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" well disciplined one and practiced with all of its systematized weaponry methods. At that time, we used the word \"\"Kalari\"\" to mean the \"\"training place\"\" from which word the name \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" was derived. After nairs had come here, \"\"Nairs\"\" also started to study \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" from our kalari traditions under strict disciplines. Like the same...\"\"Muslims\"\" and \"\"Chritians\"\" also started mastering in \"\"the kalarippayattu\"\" from \"\"Chekava Ezhavar\"\" families.You can see so many \"\"Christian & Muslim\"\" kalari experts also in the history. It doesn't mean that the \"\"kalarippayattu\"\" was brought from Arabia. The \"\"Nairs\"\" also came here some centuries back. But it had been a cultural martial orthodox tradition that was related to the blood of Malabar region as a part of its hereditary Chekava Society. But the shameless \"\"Nair Society\"\" after coming here and after studying the tricks and techniques from the people inhibited here ..now would like to teach the world that they are the main practitioners of this martial art even when this martial art has been practiced here for thousands of years by the other people in this region. If so \"\"Muslims&Christians;\"\" also can start claiming that it was brought here from Arabia.    But when the \"\"Brahmins (Namboothiris) started getting donations ( \"\" Dhanam\"\") like lands, golds, and so many things in other kind..from the rulers from our castes in ancient times  , \"\"Brahmins\"\" became landlords. \"\"Nairs\"\" also became \"\"Rich\"\" gradually when the nairs started a cheap system called \"\"Sambandham\"\"(a system of giving Nair Women to any rich traveller people in their way like \"\"Namboothiri\"\" for using that woman for a short period of time comparing to marriage,  to obtain and to posses the lands,houses and their other assets held by those traveler / Namboodhiris. I saw in the wikipedia website that, this system was stopped by social reformers playing humiliating public Dramas in front of them with the help also of Gentle Nair Men.Because it was a system like which we cant see ever in the history or ever in the world even in the people inhabiting in jungles ).In the modern world, it is not called as \"\"sambandham\"\" but we use some other words to denote these types of cultures. The same shameless system what they used to obtain \"\"Brahmin's\"\" assets, now they use to obtain the reputation regarding \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\". What the ancestors of the \"\"Nairs\"\" did \n",
      "was not a problem of \"\"Ezhavar\"\". It was just the problem of their ancestors. We don't want to feel guilty conscious in their cultural tragedy. We don't want to discuss about their past, but what makes us this much angry is their intolerance in others traditional supremacy and brutal nature to destroy our public records because of jealousy. Should we attack \"\"Nair\"\" websites in return of it?..\"\"NO\"\". We don't want to attack others. But what we want to do is we want to grow ourselves and we want to let others also to grow. This is our tradition. We don't want to attack others and we don't want to posses other's assets/cultures. And in one another point of view we can be proud also. Because even though these castes trying to include us under their  Varna System we should know that we are just above of all of these systems and , when the \"\"Brahmins\"\" came to this place, our ancestors could  give them enough Land and Accommodations and Houses considering they are \"\"Brahmins\"\". That is why the \"\"Brahmins\"\" use the word \"\"ILLAM\"\" for their houses.Because, actually the word \"\"ILLAM\"\" meant for the houses of \"\"Ezhavar\"\". Still the historical word \"\"ILLAM\"\" is used for \"\"Ezhava Houses\"\". As the \"\" Nairs\"\" were the workers of \"\"Namboothiris\"\" they also received some shares from the donations through \"\"Namboothiris\"\" and also by \"\"Sambandham\"\".

      "   Hi.  I'm not familiar with Doyle or the topic in general, but perhaps I can give you a sense of whether there should/shouldn't be an article on Doyle. With biographies of living people, there are two hurdles on this Wiki, and they largely overlapverifiability and notability. In both cases, usually the question boils down to this:  are there enough reliable, secondary sources that tell us about the subject that we can read them all, and from those sources alone write a reasonably neutral and factual article? In general such sources are going to be things like newspaper articles, magazine articles and books from reliable publishers, anything with a real editorial staff. No press releases, no use of the fellow's own web site, Facebook page, videos, etc.  For athletes like this it's also possible to fill in additional information from reliable databases of results, but notability really requires articles that discuss the subject in some level of detail. Take a look at [{WP:GNG]], and see if that helps you decide.  looks to be at least one such source,  is a reliable reference but only mentions Doyle in passing. Of the 5 sources listed on streetstunts, 4 are don't meet these requirements, and the fifth might or might notI can't tell since the page is dead.  Looks from what I can tell \"\"borderline\"\" with respect to our policies, but since you know the subject in more detail than I do (or at least I assume so) you probably know of specific resources I'm unaware of that might help flesh out the article. I hope this helps, at least a bit.  Cheers, talk to me \"\n",

Further, I notice alot of articles about Vancouver's neighbouring municipalities that do not mention the official names of such municipalities.  Why simply say \"\"Delta\"\" when one should be saying \"\"The Incorporation of Delta\"\" when the government website of that municipality uses such as a legalistic title? I know that lawyers are the only type of people who really care about municipal boundaries and official names, but this is still Wikipedia and all the technical and legalistic details should be mentioned.  After all, municipalities, whether a city, town, township, village, etc., are merely creations of the law of incorporation.\n",

This article should not use the simple word \"\"Vancouver\"\" to mean the larger metro area that includes Burnaby, Richmond, etc.  Doing so would be very confusing to a reader in view of the Greater Vancouver Area map with all those municipal boundaries drawn in.\n",

I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  \n",
      "\n",
      " Why it wasn't a personal attack \n",
      "\"\"The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm.\"\" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is \"\"Disruption\"\".  Under this it has \n",

While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, \"\"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia\"\" and I agree with it.  The point here is \"\"personal\"\".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an \"\"in joke\"\" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the \"\"attack\"\" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was \"\"attacked\"\", you would not be able to do this.  \n",

From WP:CIVIL, \"\"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress\"\".  My signature was not \"\"personally targeted behavior\"\" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of \"\"conflict\"\" or \"\"stress\"\".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.\n",

If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   \n",

      "Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  \n",

      "I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   23:43, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n",

The most important illuminator of the 16th century, he was a 'Michelangelo of small works', according to Vasari. Many of his documented works are dispersed or untraced, and some attributions are controversial, but his secure oeuvre gives a clear idea of his stylistic influences and development. Although much of his inspiration came from Raphael and Michelangelo, he developed his own visual language, brilliantly translating their monumental forms for work on the smallest scale.\n",

In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.\n",

Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.\n",

Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.\n",

Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.  \n",

      "How can it not be personal? Healthcare is about people's lives. Imagine if I was writing an article predominantly about the failings of allopathic medicine, of which there are still more than a few. Would it be a fair representation, and provide positive recommendations about the elements of allopathic medicine which could be trusted by those who may benefit from it? I am one of those people who has benefited from natural medicine in ways many GPs are still ill informed about. I had chronic hayfever that antihistamines could do little about without making me drowsy (I know they counteract it with stimulants now) due to boosting areas of my diet I rarely get a sniffle. Did a GP tell me about it? No. When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia I was given antipsychotic medication that stopped the voices, but induced symptoms of severe clinical depression and chronic fatigue which even the Psychiatrists who prescribed them failed to recognise as side-effects. Some time after when I told a state psychiatrist I was taking herbal medication he told me \"\"oh we're supposed to know about those sorts of things.\"\" There are also dietary changes that assist different mental illness which you won't get from many doctors. Now say I was a young lad again, and I was confronted with such ideas as you can't cure allergies with natural medicine, or that herbal medications are less effective. (A Joke. Some herbs are scheduled for a reason). Can you say that being discouraged from seeking the best qualified practitioner I could would be good for my health? Not that I'd go to wikipedia for that, at least not as anything more than an introductory paragraph or two and some further links. Call me naive, but I'd like to see a future where wikipedia can be relied upon as at least a good portal to reputable agencies, but there is no such place on wikipedia for Naturopathy in Australia, just as well in a way that the first two google searches, including the google definition of naturopathy come from the ANTA. Sure it'd be nice to have the first search as somewhere which offers a balanced critique, but no such place exists outside of reading long journal articles, and how many in the general public do that. Naturopathy is increasingly adopted by the general public in australia, you see it in mainstream pharmacies and in integrated medical practices now as well as health food shops and the call centres of vitamin companies. I'd prefer it to be the best quality possible, which is why I'm in favour of a critique of the more debatable therapies, and regulation which requires a high level of education. But nobody who's already interested in natural therapies is going to get much out of the wikipedia article as it is because they will see nothing but bias, and for people who are skeptical all it will do is agree with their skepticism. It challenges nobody, except the poor naturopathy student who wants it to be better.  \"\n",

For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself.

But here is the point: this relabelling truly does hide which of the basis vectors span V; it is possible to form a product for every element in the ring, but impossible to identify the original subspace V used in the construction.  The quaternions are a ring isomorphic to Cℓ0,2(ℝ), which has a 1,2,1 grading structure.  Yet, given ℍ, can you find a unique decomposition with this grading structure?  No.  In a CA, grading specifically refers to a unique/natural decomposition into (I think it is into a direct sum of) 0-vectors, 1-vectors, 2-vectors etc.  talkcontr 19:22\"\n",

I accepted the removal of the section on the \"\"ERO crisis\"\", which was unsourced and out of date, although quite interesting. That was not critical of your school, but I think it would have been more appropriate for you to have suggested its removal on the talk page rather than doing so yourself.-gadfium \n",

      "Thanks for the message.  Not sure where we go to from here or what is your motivation for this Wiki.  Are you a past pupil?  The BOT are confused why you are seeking to edit the Wiki when the school and the BOT are the legal owners of the school and its information.  Quite happy to stick within the guidelines of Wikipedia but who is making the judgement calls on what is relevant content eg \"\"generally regarded by residents as less conservative\"\" where is the evidence i.e. facts to substantiate this claim?  Who decides Karamu's Alumni?  All information on our website has been written with BOT delegated authority and is the proprty of the BOT so no problems there.  Will follow up on other suggestions regarding edit accounts etc when I have more knowledge as still a first time user and know very little apart from the wiki page for KHS is simply not an accurate information page for KHS in 2010 and the BOT are not happy as democratically elected trustees of the school to have this continue.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 222.153.15.181   \n",

To put any material on Wikipedia is to licence it under Wikipedia's Terms of Use, which is under a CC-BY-SA licence. I am not allowing the material to be added to Wikipedia verbatim without such proof, because I am protecting the school's copyright. The simplest method of providing proof that the material on the school website can be copied to Wikipedia - and any other publisher which wishes to redistribute Wikipedia's content - is to add a copyright notice to the page in question saying that the contents are released\n",

I'm happy for the page to be edited if anyone has better sources than me. I think that part of the issue is that his peak in popularity was during a period where the internet barely existed. It probably also doesn't help that he's Australian and therefore not as well known as he may be if he was on American television. He would regularly sell out 2,000-3,000 seat venues during his peak.

      " Thanks for the compliment! It's true, content is my main passion. I am happiest when doing lots of content creation/editing and community building, and I believe I do my best work when happy, and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions. I tend to go through cycles in my editing. Recently, there's been a great deal of content creation that interests me, so that's what I've been most focused on. (A major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders, which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the WP community.) When I get less inspired on content, I tend to go on Recent changes patrol, jump into an XfD or RfA debate, etc. In my opinion, it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content, and make brief forays into administrative duties. I recognize that some hold differing views; to them I would say, it's essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use, other projects like Commons and Wikinews, deletion debates, mediation, etc. to act accordingly. I certainly feel that I have enough experience with that stuff. I have nominated numerous articles for deletion, using speedy, PROD and AfD procedures; I don't know a good way to assess the results, but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved. I do lots of vandalism reversion, and would estimate that I include subst'ed  templates about 80% of the time. I have recommended the occasional block for stuff like 3RR. I participate in CfD's and IfD's. I'm familiar with lots of criteria (like speedy delete); I would not claim to know any by rote, but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly.\n",

      "In the process of reviewing the situation involving the various articles on Islamic scholarship Islamic mathematics, Islamic science, Islamic metaphysics etc.  which have been subject to extensive edit-warring and outright deletion or stubbing in the case of some articles by two groups of editors broadly labeled Islamophiles and anti-Revisionists  a third group of people who might be termed Irrelevantists as they were unfamiliar with the subject and considered it non-notable due to religious content (which the anti-revisionist history buffs do not; they merely are vehemently against anything in the article that smacked of promotion) referred folks to the old discussions that led to the deletion of the \"\"Professionals by religion\"\" Category, e.g. CfD:Astronomers by religion and CfD:Mathematicians by religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vast consensus of those two discussions were that religion was utterly irrelevant to the personal or professional life of those professionals and even asked \"\"when would it end?\"\" Much cracks were had about how religion was once relevant to scientists' lives but is now a historical curiosity. However the discussion boiled down to it being a non-intersecting and \"\"frankly absurd\"\" means of categorizing people.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I find interesting is that the same policies could be provided for Category:Women by occupation and yet no one has ever proposed deletion of that entire (huge) category tree, and in fact insisted on the exact opposite arguments, despite the fact that some women actively do object to being labeled as a \"\"Woman scientist\"\", whereas no astronomer has ever objected to being labeled religious despite the disingenuous claim made in the above CfD. \n",

If it had been \"\"Muslim earth scientists\"\" or another religion, it would have been deleted \"\"with extreme prejudice\"\" and some vitriol by \"\"science vs. religion\"\" types. But the rationale used would have been that it was non-intersecting and an article couldn't be written about it, which seems to be being selectively applied by Brightists on this site. (Some of these categories, an article could be written but that doesn't mean a category should exist, as one person on the \"\"Female\"\" CfD noted.

If it is reheard by the full Court, or the Supreme Court, you'll get another bite at the apple. You and SaltyBoatr, among others, apparently wish it were otherwise. Not only am I not some chickensh-t anonymous pundit, you can reach me at marty_eble@yahoo.com. Get a law degree or quite mucking the entry up.

      "Comment by Mattchewbaca – I would just like to commend you THR, for putting forth the time and effort to put this problem into perspective. Hopefully, with the great investigative work you have demonstrated here, this will send a message to these editors that their GA reviewing buddy circle is not to be taken seriously. Beyond the reciprocity of this group and their articles is the depreciated level of their reviewing knowledge. Some in this group, with or without realizing it, are responsible for the current diminished state of GA class articles. While I can't speak for each and every one of these editors, I have had personal experience with a few of them, two of which are , and .\n",

      "The article Halfway Gone, which was nominated by  and reviewed by , in September 2010, was selected by myself to undergo WP:GAR. As you can see, the article clearly does not meet the WP:GA requirements. Many of the refs are duplicates of one another, including: Refs 19 and 35, 20 and 37, 21 and 33, 22 and 34, 23 and 40. There is the use of both Nielsen Business Media and Prometheus Global Media for the Billboard references. There are refs that do not support actual claims. Two-thirds of the Live performances section is factually inaccurate, seeing as though they are not live performances but instead taped and aired later that evening. My attempt at a successful de-listing of the article was met with resistance and consequently it still remains as a GA.\n",

      " reviewed Howling Bells (album), an article which I nominated for GA. He quick-failed the article within 57 minutes of creating the review page. His review baffled me, it seemed as though he did not have the knowledge required to actually be reviewing an article because the majority of his claims, as far as faults in the article went, were unfounded, they simply were not true. The other points in the article he claimed as weaknesses easily could have fixed within ten minutes.\n",

David Lucas (composer) is another GA nominated article that he has had quick-failed just this week.

These editors have flooded the market with their paltry articles and now GA is not a true representation. I find it amusing that these editors still nominate their articles for GA as if it's a noteworthy achievement... it makes me ponder. They seem to not realize that their GA articles are in the same league with a C-class article masquerading as a GA. Even though my comments were a bit off topic, I would again like to express gratitude to you THR, for casting light upon this matter which needs to be properly addressed at an administrative level. This act of back scratching amongst these editors as well as their abominable reviewing standards has to cease if GA status is to exemplify what it truly stands for.  (meow) \"\n",

To point out one thing, I'll bring up Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012.

I'll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic, so the article is riddled with grammatical errors, mostly incomplete sentences.

      "You will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die. I wonder if these mercenary editors here have any idea that their policing of these pages could be leading to actual deaths in the world, as thousands of people take poison in a desperate attempt to save their lives, when they are not even sick.\n",

Also, while I understand your concerns over the article, there are bits of policy that have become standard, and while I mean no offense, it is in fact discouraged that PR firms edit the articles of people or organizations they represent (see WP:AUTO) due to concerns that a potential conflict of interest in one's editing could result in a non-neutral point of view, which is often remedied by the edits of uninvolved, neutral editors without an opinion over a piece. I'm going to see if I can find someone else to expand on this a little bit more, but on the mean time I will add the article to my watchlist and revert any vandalism or additions of unsourced material to help out, per WP:BIO.

      "Hi there,\n",
      "I just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself. I'm not trying to cause a stir here, but, I find it strange that Bards page was ripped down, when in fact I have found a few other artists pages that have been left up, and do not contain the same concrete documentation as Bard Of Ely's did. If you would like me to point those out to you, all you have to do is ask !!!! Take care, and please understand, that I am trying to understand some of the standards you work under for deciding to remove pages of Wikipedia noteable musical artists. Thank you, be well, and please accept my questions with all seriousness.\n",

      "Born John Webb, John Silas Wilson A.K.A. “BIG HITZ” was born in Chicago Illinois along with eight siblings. Problems in the household ended or so it would seem with his mother losing the rights to all nine of her children. “BIG HITZ” then lived in foster homes, orphanages, and group homes for about five years before a family he was staying with took him in. “BIG HITZ”, 13 at the time was happy but his new family loved government money more than they loved him and when it came to his music “Hip Hop-Rap”, the family that took him in didn’t want him listening to “Hip Hop-Rap” or writing it. But “BIG HITZ” had his first taste of “Hip Hop-Rap” by listening to a rap group called Bone Thugs N Harmony and later, another rapper named Nas. “Big Hitz” had been writing since the early age of 13, and by the time he was 14 years old, he took his first step into a studio to do his first song called “ I represent”. Having a “Hard Knock Life” and hitting a rock bottom couldn’t stop “BIG HITZ” from writing and pursuing the American dream. Through writing and doing music, he found sanity in all of the madness that was going on in his life. At the age of 19, “BIG HITZ” moved in with a friend from High school and formed a group called “BASS & TREBLE” After successfully putting together a Record called “ THE BASS & TREBLE 7 HITZ ep. “BIG HITZ” had a huge sense of accomplishment but the Record went nowhere. After splitting with his friend and partner, “BIG HITZ” set out to build a strong solo career. After recording a solid demo and song catalog, “BIG HITZ” decided to move from Michigan to California.living in michigan brings you to present day. Written By Gisele S. Uwitonze'Bold text'\n",
