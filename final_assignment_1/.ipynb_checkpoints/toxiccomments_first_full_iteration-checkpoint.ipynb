      "Now even the discussion attempts to further contextualize and diminish the Red Army's crimes!  The Red Army's crimes remain crimes - there is always a context and a reason for any crime committed by anyone.  What Wehrmacht or SS soldiers did or did not do in no way justifies or sufficiently contextualizes-away rapes committed against women aged 8 (and lower) to 80+. Unfortunately that is what this article in its present form attempts to do. On top of that, this article about rape gives no voice to the raped and only offers voices of the perpetrators that dismiss the accusations.  It's rather perverse, misogynistic, and revisionist.  A more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic would be to give a straight-forward account of the wide-spread rapes/violence by the Red Army, including accounts from various Nazi|women/victims.  After that, background/context should be given to help understand why this happened, but never in a way that implies that crimes do not remain crimes.  In addition, a section on Soviet/Russian ways of interpreting/handling on the violence/rapes would be informative as well.  In its current form, this article does Wikipedia a disservice and is yet another example of a biased and amateurish account of history that cements Wikipedia's reputation as an unreliable source of information.  It is only by tackling these types of issues effectively that the Wikipedia community can prove it can be a viable source of information.  \n",

      "Contextualizing the supposed crimes, as claimed by Udibi, is not the same thing as diminishing those acts of punishment inflicted on the Nazis for murdering 20,000,000 people.  I find his reference to SS Paramilitary as soldiers to be deeply disturbing, a-historical, ill-informed, and suspicious, as SS Paramilitaries were not soldiers and were not even part of the military.  While Nazi acts of genocide do not in themselves justify rape, they make it very understandable why people who assisted in the worst mass murder in history were punished by the surviving victims.  Related, the Nazis were very popular and had massive support from the population, who in turn offered no resistance to the Nazi regime; he who keeps silent consents; these women were therefore active supporters of the Holocaust.  It would not have been difficult for them to fight against the Nazis in some way, and they should not receive sympathy for not doing so and allowing 20,000,000 people to be murdered.  I really see no problem of revisionism here.  I recommend that other editors be very wary of this proposal to create a self proclaimed more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic as it may lead us to perpetuating the moral equivalency arguments of covert Holocaust deniers.\n",

I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like \"\"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage\"\" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg.

As for your other admonitions, concerning my responses to this person Hoary, I have been attempting to improve the article via a constructive colloquy with the editor Æµ§œš¹.  This Hoary person appears get his or her orgasmic jollies making asinine slurs and commentary that does not address the subject of Ebonics nor the inconsistencies in his or her logic.  I have verbally cleaned this person Hoary’s clock and yet this person Hoary keeps coming back for more.  Clearly this person Hoary loves the sadomasochistic verbal exchanges that he or she has invited and is having with me.  You would do better to make your admonitions to this Hoary person because I will not tolerate ‘dog whistle’ insults and racial slurs from Hoary, you or anyone else.  So you just block my edits all you want. Blocking my edits won’t make the inaccuracies and outright lies that Wikipedia is disseminating on the subject of Ebonics accurate or true.   If this person Hoary wants to discuss Black English or African American Vernacular English he or she should take his or her discussion to the Wikipedia Black English or African American Vernacular English section or page.  Ebonics is not Black English, African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the language of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans is a dialect of English and genetically akin to the Germanic language family to which English belongs.  If you do not understand this fact then why was the Wikipedia African Diaspora project initiated? You should have called it the Black Anglo Saxon Diaspora Project instead.  But then, there would have to be historical linguistic evidence that Black Anglo Saxons brought Early Modern Black English, African American Vernacular English dialects to colonial America from somewhere in Germanic Europe. \n",

It's from the BBC and the ILO list should be in because the numbers are coming from one highly reliable organization, if not the most reliable one, so we are comparing apples to apples, even if there are some flaws in that method. That flaw, as Ahecht suggested, should be mentioned in the methodology. But blanking out such a highly reliable source because of that is unacceptable and a serious violation of WP:NPOV.

The water will accumulate in the plant creating a slight root pressure. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special leaf tip or edge structures, hydathodes, forming drops.

I am sure your mother is very proud of your Wikipedia J.D. law degree, but you are not getting any more of my time to contribute to your project and correct your obvious falsehoods and text that does not clearly appear to have been written by an English speaker familiar with Heidegger and able to name even a few of his main concepts. Please point me to the place in the article where even one of H's primary philosophical concepts are reasonably explained, so that a reader may have any idea of what he is after. The current page leaves everyone less intelligent and knowledgeable than they were before reading it. I promise you, that you are not getting even one minute more of my time in any event.  This article is so bad that it needs to be gone through paragraph by paragraphy and replaced my new content. Nearly every paragraph in it leaves the reader knowing less true things about Heidegger than the reader knew before. If you would like to actually know something about Heidegger, read the article I wrote. I managed to explain in the lead the main ideas which one needs to know about Heidegger. The current article does not even succesfully explain Heidegger's thought or his importance within the entire article, and inculcates a number of gross and vulgar misconceptions. It would be almost impossible to imagine a philosophy article that was filled with more sophmoric drivel, and reads like a machine-translated text of an undergraduate who has never read the author, and wishes to spread as much misinformation as possible. If you prefer reading an article that seems to claim that Heidegger has only been read in France and is unable to successfully name or explain EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF HEIDEGGER'S CONCEPTS, please by all means, waste your time on doing so.

This is entirely a hypothetical question, by the way - I'm not expecting to visit the US in the near future, and I don't write Esq after my name anyway - I'm just curious as to the exact legal standing of the term in the US.\n",

Then came the corralito, etc. On the whole, the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the IMF were recommending them. I don't remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. Note also that \"\"economic collapse\"\" doesn't refer only to the critical period November 2001 - February 2002, but to the whole recessive period (1999-2002) and some time before and after.

But the world is not perfect, and his being the first black president of America represents a historical shift in race relations.  Perhaps ten years from now societal mores will change and it will not figure so prominently.  Wikipedia as an encyclopedia is a product of its times, and inasmuch as it draws on sources with cultural biases, it is a product of the various cultures that produce the sources it cites.  It's not practical to try to achieve objectivity through logical analysis - that's also a form of bias.\n",

Taking a look at your  as well as Behavioral targeting, Targeted advertising and Target market, I think there is enough overlap between the three that some of your content could go in each. This is a bit more difficult than adding a single addition at first. It's harder to get up to speed when you start and stop. But quickly I think you'll find that adding small changes bit by bit to different articles is fast and useful. You'll get into the habit of thinking about claims and sources, and making sure each claim is matched to a source to verify it. And you'll find ways in which articles that seem ok could really use some help. Take a look at (not to pick on it) Targeted advertising. We mention two studies, but focus on both too narrowly in terms of scope and time. \"\"controversies\"\" are mentioned in their own section but could be integrated with benefits.

      "I think since the end of the Cold War to present the United Kingdom has played the second largest role in the world after the United States, and after all the role a country plays in the world is what defines a super power. Also the United Kingdom demonstrated that it can single handedly and quickly defeat a regional power and quickly resolve a conflict when it won the Falklands War. This is more than what can be said for such countries as the United States or Former Soviet Union. After the Second World War and during the 1950s the United Kingdom was considered to be a super power because of the role it played in the world but the after effect of the Suez crisis made this disappear. The Falklands war and Thatcher-Reagen era displayed the UK was preparing to retrieve its status as being on the same level as the USA and USSR. Soon after this the Cold War ended and with no Soviet Union left to counter the United Kingdom in any way (like in the Suez crisis) the Thatcher-Reagen duo had worked and the United Kingdom set in motion activities to reclaim such a postion it had in the world that it had in the world before the Suez crisis in time for the beginning of the 21st century. The 1990s was a bit of a prelude to today and saw the United Kingdom slowly begin to prepare as being a power equal to the US and former USSR by being eager to greatly contribute to the Gulf War and and Yugoslav wars and grew more involed in Western Africa by sending troops there to resolve conflict in Sierra Leone and was testing its place as second most powerful in the world to the US and in being a semi super power again. Soon afterwards September 11th happened and the War on Terror that followed gave the United Kingdom just what it needed to reassert itself on the world stage and came just at the right time to have given the United Kingdom time to perpare and try out its future after the end of the Cold War and for the beginning of the 21st century. Today the United Kingdom is easily seen as being second most powerful on the world stage diplomatically and even militarily and could be called a semi super power. People have started to raise this issue called the British Moment in the 21st century. The United Kingdom also acts very much as a deciding force in NATO and the EU in which policy they take or their futures in whether it decides to side with the US or EU and can have an effect around the world. It also greatly influences the other 52 members of the Commonwealth of Nations which it heads by its monarch and is the largest body other than the UN. Not to mention its influence and veto power of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n",

Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester is the most senior male-line male descendant of Victoria & Albert as he is the surviving son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, as the Duke's two elder brothers, Edward and Albert (who reigned as George VI) had no sons, is since the death of his elder brother, William in 1972, the senior male-line male grandchild of George V, who was the surviving son of Edward VII, the first son of Victoria & Albert. Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nonethelles, his British cousins from the Windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. We can say that Prince Andreas is the senior male-line descendant of Prince Albert in right of the former realm of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as the elder lines of his descendants (thourgh Edward VII and Arthur, Duke of Connaught, now extinct in male-line) renounced their rights to it, but definitely he is not Prince Albert's senior male-line descendant in general.\n",

Gena was voted out of the EBAN board and SHE is the one with the 2 year old grudge. I was simply adding my links and she was the one that kept deleting them, I just marely re-instated them. This is not about Wikipedia, just the 'latest' of her attacks. She has written to the Attorney General of the US, of California, the Dept of Agricolture and others telling them that EBAN is non-compliant (a lie) and asking them to shut us down. She placed a bogus complaint with Yahoo which resulted in one of my Yahoo IDs to be deleted. She makes all kinds of outlandish and false claims that no-one bothers to investigate because if they did, they would know they are bogus. Just makes me very sad that everyone thinks I am the one with the grudge when all I have ever done is tring to defend myself from a liar. I've done nothing at Wikipedia that was inappropriate or harrassing, all I was doing was trying to add my links, which were promptly deleted by Gena. I am the victim here!!!\n",

      "The \"\"critical reception of the series\"\" section has been amended to reflect data taken directly from the series.  It does not speculate on reasons for the data, beyond identifying trends.  That the wife of the series editor appeared in the series, where the series editor is the primary screener of selections (but does not make final selections), is a notable fact, however one interprets it.  Given that Lehman has indicated thousands, if not tens of thousands, of poems are read for each issue of the anthologyand only 75 get inthe selection of his wife, who does not meet the notability criteria for a writer on Wikipedia, and has not published extensively elsewhere, is relevant to criticism of the series. The same can be said for those who have assisted Lehman with the production of the series, as well as those who have worked with or studied under Lehman.  Whether or not the trends are dispositive is beside the point (though mathematically, they are \"\"statistically significant\"\"); the point is that criticism of the series is based on this information.  While the blogosphere may not a preferred citation, previous edits of this entry prove that if it were necessary to establish (for the \"\"critical reception\"\" portion of the entry, not the entry proper) the above criticism as pervasive in the only sphere it is alleged (in the article) to be pervasivethe blogosphereit would be a matter of picking which high-traffic links (of the dozens available) to select, and not whether any could be found.  On the blogosphere, it is simply the case that discussion of the BAP does not occur outside the context, or exclusive of the backdrop, of persistent allegations of cronyism against the series, and that it is the data that fuels this speculation, not whimsy or fancy.  \"\n",

      "I MUST object to this. When I originally put forth my version of MastCell and Nightscream's \"\"argument\"\", I was told I was not addressing the article, but just babbling on the issue. So, I defended myself that this is directly related to the article and its POV. Then, I was told, that somehow paraphrasing the argument used to push POV is somehow an \"\"attack\"\" on the editors!! And that I \"\"misattributed\"\" them. Fine, I'll deal with that later. Okay, so let me get this straight. People push a POV on an article. They use specific arguments to justify pushing their POV (the endless bickering over \"\"scientific consensus\"\", \"\"scientific community\"\", \"\"facts\"\", \"\"who is a scientist\"\", just read the last 3 years' discussion pages). I come onto this discussion page, and I point out how pathetic their arguments used to push their POV are. When I do this, I am told I am \"\"not addressing the article to improve it\"\", and that I'm \"\"attacking the editors\"\" (!!) and that if I continue to do this, I will be banned. Whatever. Nightscream said: \"\"I made none of the \"\"arguments\"\" you attributed to me, nor do I recall MastCell doing so either.\"\" But you said: \"\"It indicates that it is referring exclusively to those who follow the Scientific Method, and not any ol' Tom, Dick and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage.\"\" It does not take a ph.d. to figure out that by \"\"any ol' Tom, Dick, and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage\"\" you mean Duesberg, Perth, David Crowe, AIDS Wiki, and Virusmyth, and all the people associated with them. Hence, by your own words, you are saying that all these people, the \"\"Tom, Dick, and Harry\"\"'s, are not following the \"\"scientific method\"\" and are thus not part of your \"\"scientific community\"\". And this is my point. You DEFINE anyone who rejects the hypothesis as necessarily not following scientific method, hence not a member of the scientific community, then claim there's 100% or near 100% agreement in the scientific community that HIV causes AIDS.

In particular, phrases like \"\"Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals\"\" (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition.

Typically, a being from the Reverse Maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions (we see when Crimson, LOVE and the Sacks return to the Dark World, they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface).  My assumption is that an object such as the Yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use.  Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.  After the Sacks summon the clock, Crimson and LOVE throw over defeated opponents (already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff) into each number, with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the Yamiking. -\n",

That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.\"\"\n",

In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later\n",

Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's \"\"likely true of most subordinated individuals\"\" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)\n",

      "2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research \"\"reinforces stereotypes\"\" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct.

The several weeks I have been here has been an interesting experience. I learned a lot, wandering around the Random articles. I also tried to contribute on issues that I know well. I had my share of learning other people's academic formation and their inner world (psychologies)i.e. how they react to the unknown or suppressed. As a social scientist, I was surprised to see the magnified importance of the behaviour and perception factors. I think I should learn more on social psychology and related behavioural disciplines to apply in my work. To cut a long story short, I think I have been doing my humble contribution to the WP but believe could have done more in this rather short period, should I not faced reactionary attitudes, especially on \"\"national\"\" issues. It is really astonishing to see how people react to editing events that have occurred before our grandfathers were born, if they suspect their world of conceived reality is threatened. Never mind if these words look confusing to you, because they also are for me. I know I simply received a -perhaps automated- welcome message from you and am not expecting an answer to these lines. Indeed I am writing more as a factor of self inspection and will certainly erase these lines after a short while. All the best.  \"\n",

It certainly seems to be trending towards Begley's view that it's a manufactured controversy with no substance to it. I suggest taking Begley out of the lead, and out of the article altogether for now, and then re-adding her view as part of a summary of post-Muir Russell opinion.\n",

There are a number of possible reasons you might think the above quote was unacceptable, including (1) you think I was threatening to abuse GAR to pursue a personal vendetta rather than to improve the encyclopedia; (2) you think CurtisNaito's article edits are awesome and for me to criticize them constitutes a personal attack; (3) you think what I said constituted a threat and regardless of its merit it created a hostile editing environment; (4) you think it violated some policy I am not aware of regarding off-wiki drafts or some such... (I'm going to stop there.)\n",
      "If (1): As I have already clarified, the GA criteria indicate that those articles should be either improved to bring them up to legitimate GA status, or reassessed. CurtisNaito's track record of OWNership and edit-warring indicates that the former is impossible, leaving the latter option. Reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy, and I wasn't actually threatening to do so anyway; I was threatening not to do so. In my two years of arguing with CurtisNaito, I have in all but one occasion (the Emperor Jimmu article) chosen the carrot over the stick.\n",
      "If (2): You should express that opinion in an appropriate forum like an article talk page or the currently open History of Japan GAR. Blocking one side of a content dispute because you happen to agree with the other is inappropriate, especially when the other side has explicitly violated an ANI final warning numerous times over the past two weeks. (Note that I don't actually think this is why you blocked me. I'm grabbing at straws.)\n",
      "If (3): You may be right, but look what I have had to deal with: CurtisNaito has requested four times in the last five months, on both ANI and ArbCom, that I be site-banned for disagreeing with his edits, even though pretty much everyone else disagrees with them too. If there's a hostile editing environment, I'm not the one to blame. And as in (1) above, it was not a threat anyway  I was offering a favour in exchange for CurtisNaito granting me the favour of not requesting that I be site-banned anymore. If this is what you meant, it's a good faith misunderstanding, and I will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, but I should still be unblocked.\n",

      "Hi there.  Perhaps I'm behind the times though I do try to keep up with the \"\"news\"\" and with \"\"global\"\" events, but, I get the feeling that ISIS does not really exist.  Just as there is an excellent chance that Al-Qaeda does not really exist.  I was especially inspired to post this comment when I saw in the first paragraph of this article use the neologism \"\"jihadist\"\".  It doesn't take much brain power to know that there is no one in the world, besides maybe a few deeply stupid solo acts who keep up with thew western media, who refer to themselves as \"\"jihadists\"\".  That is a habit of english speaking people to combine two words from different languages -in this case, arabic and english.  Similarly, there is no centralized organization known as the Taliban, no organization or action known as \"\"Islamist\"\" no organization known as al-Qaeda.  Notice also, that even the purported mission of \"\"ISIS\"\" is not Islamic in its nature.  I know what folks want to ask: then how is it that words like jihadist, islamist, taliban, al-qaeda, and ISIS exist?  Its called orientailsim.  The Palestinian scholar Edward Said wrote extensively on the history of english speaking people, and other imperialists, who purposely attack and misrepresent Muslim peoples.  It started with the Crusades.  I don't mean to be a no it all, but ought we just believe what we are told?  Is there a way to find empirical evidence that they do exist?  If they do exist -what are we talking about?  A few people who never studied Shariah in the first place.   10 August, 2014\"\n",

In addition, just a few minor stylistic improvements - (1) the introduction does not state, or even imply, the incredible fame and importance of this battle. If I came across this article, somehow having never heard of Salamis, I'd read the intro and think \"\"oh, this is just another one of those battles from those Greek wars that I never understood anything about\"\", and I'd move on. As it stands now, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom in order to see anything about the importance and fame of the battle. (2) I wonder if there is any better way to organize the listing of the numbers of ships. Obviously, regular paragraph form will look quite confusing and ugly, and a table would likely take up just as much space as the list... can anything be done here? Maybe a table with multiple columns? Otherwise, a very nice article for a very major topic.

The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.

EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.\n",

      "Both of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.\n",
      "\n",
      "The club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.\n",
      "\n",
      "The historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Houlding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.\n",

So I dont understand how someone can come to the conclusion that the leader of North Korea is a figure who is not in a position inacessible to the genenral public. Are we supposed to wait until Kim Jong Un dies before we can get a fair-use provision? Or are we making conclusions that because somebody might be able to take a photograph of him in an unspecified future timeframe, fair-use is rendered incompatible with any content depicting him. Im not usually involved in license debates, but I seriously think this is already one of the worst world leader articles ive seen in a while and the lack of image is a huge part of it (he is currently the only world leader who is missing an image).\n",

The 'Heyland factor', or it's unidentified equivalent, is how you derive transformer or motor from short-circuit and open-circuit measurements, which is a classical approach to doing it and which Leakage inductance article has been trying to describe incorrectly for several years. This stuff is proposed in Leakage inductance article, not in Transformer article proper. I am not proposing anything major in difference in Transformer article proper. Right now, everything about Leakage inductance is nonsense, so the alternative is to scrap Leakage inductance article. But there can be no doubt about the substance of the derivation per se. One may quibble with the presentation and the naming of this stuff but not with the substance. I will address these issues in proposed changes to Leakage inductance article. You are the one who suggested to start with ideal transformer and to first with linear (cum real) transformer. So back to the question: How do you fill the gaps between ideal and real?

      "I thought you might like to see this. It's a letter the Governing Body received in 1980 from the Watch Tower's chairman's committee, before the Governing Body disfellowshipped many senior Witnesses for \"\"apostasy\"\", and the reason was they were discussing these teachings below. I happen to agree with the points that disagree with traditional Watch Tower doctrine. You would also find it interesting reading Raymond Franz's discussion of each of these points in his two books, Crisis of Conscience and In search of Christian Freedom, and after see if you can still refute them using the Bible as your guide. The letter is below:\n",

      "Following are some of the wrong teachings being spread as emanating from Bethel. These have been brought to the attention of the Governing Body from the field from April 14 onward.\n",

      "1. That Jehovah does not have an organization on earth today and its Governing Body is not being directed by Jehovah.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3. There is no proper arrangement as a \"\"faithful and discreet slave\"\" class made up of the anointed ones and their Governing Body to direct affairs of Jehovah's people. At Matthew 24:45 Jesus used this expression only as an illustration of faithfulness of individuals. Rules are not needed only follow the Bible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. There are not two classes today, the heavenly class and those of the earthly class also called \"\"other sheep\"\" at John 10:16\n",
      "\n",
      "5. That the number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 is symbolic and not to be taken as literal. Those of the \"\"great crowd\"\" mentioned at Revelation 7:9 also serve in heaven as indicated in vs. 15 where it is claimed that such crowd serves \"\"day and night\"\" in his temple (naos) or K. int says: \"\"in the divine habitation of him.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. That we are now living in a special period of \"\"last days\"\" but that the \"\"last days\"\" started 1900 years ago C.E. 33 as indicated by Peter at Acts 2:17 when he quoted from the prophet Joel.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. That 1914 is not an established date. Christ Jesus was not enthroned then but has been ruling in his kingdom since C.E.33. That Christ's presence (parousia) is not yet but when the \"\"sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven\"\" (Matthew 24:30) in the future.\n",

      "I think I have a way to resolve this unfortunate Billy the Kid issue. If you will give me a moment, I first want to explain how we got to this point from my perspective. A lot has been made over my alleged failure to adhere to the preferred Wikipedia manual of style. That failure on my part is simply not being as well versed on the various Wikipedia guidelines as I probably should be. I am not trying to disrupt your standards. Indeed, I would appreciate any and all the help I can get, along with the active participation by experienced Wikipedia editors to bring the Billy the Kid article in line with Wikipedia standards. \n",

      "I am not trying to defy or insult anyone. There seems to be a misunderstanding that suggests I seem to think that I have some kind of \"\"ownership\"\" over the subject of Billy the Kid.

Perhaps some of this misunderstanding stems from a sentence I could have worded better which read as follows: \"\"All I was trying to do was provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "If I could take back the word \"\"template\"\" I would, since it was clearly construed as meaning something totally different from what I was trying to state.  What I was trying to state comes down simply to accurate \"\"facts and dates\"\" regarding Billy the Kid, and bringing the state of those many \"\"facts and dates\"\" up to date to this point in time. Before it was removed, my Wikipedia article reflected the status of Billy the Kid research as it exists today. There were 147 detailed citations, which sourced the work of such noted Kid historians as Philip J. Rasch, Robert M. Utley and Frederick Nolan among many others. Before it was last removed on December 17, that version that I was working on contained the most accurate version of the Kid's life that has yet appeared on Wikipedia. That version of the article contained contributions by several researchers - not just me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it all went away, when the article was removed for reasons that make no sense - at least not for anything contained in the article itself. I attempted to restore the version that I had been working on at 11:47 17 December 2015. I attached a note that read: \"\"Please do not delete this version of the Billy the Kid article. It contains the contributions of several respected historians, and remains the most comprehensive, and accurate treatment of the subject that has appeared on Wikipedia so far.\"\"\n",

      "My restoration only stayed up for 4 minutes and and was once again removed at 11:51 on 17 December 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made what turned out to be a final attempt at restoration six minutes later at 11:57 17 December 2015. This time I left a note that said \"\"The continued deletion of an article by myself, and several other contributors, goes beyond vandalism and borders on being criminal.\"\" The crime was against historical honesty, accuracy and, indeed, the goals that Wikipedia is supposed to stand for. The total lack of respect to those who contributed to the article goes without saying.\n",

      "This time, for my troubles, I was blocked - and my blocked status remains in effect until Dec. 24. Merry Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The irony is that when the version of the article I last worked on was deleted,  on December 17, I was done with it. I had no plans for further changes. I had hoped that others would then jump in - particularly those who possess the Wikipedia editorial skills I lacked to make it go along with your manual of style and other Wikipedia preferences.\n",

      "Billy the Kid, as you all know, was born in lower Manhattan in New York City. I would like to use New York City as an analogy for how I view Wikipedia. Since the early 1960's I've spent a considerable amount of time, off and on,  in New York City. Those of you who have been there frequently know that there is always construction going on. Indeed, change is a constant in New York City. Change is also a constant with any Wikipedia article. As stated, it was never my intention to \"\"own\"\" the article. I never expected, or wanted, it to remain frozen in place with my contributions. I was looking forward to contributions from other historians and researchers who could provide further info on the \"\"facts and dates\"\" contained in the article, as well as working with experienced Wikipedia editors who could correct any mistakes that didn't go along with your preferred \"\"encyclopedic\"\" standards.\n",

      "\"CCD affecting other insects?==\n",
      "While all this is certainly entertaining, the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse, mankind will not disappear. Wild pollinator insects, animals, and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. Even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer, humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point it's not clear yet that CCD only affects bees.  It certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder.  Also, the quote may be overly simplified.  But the big picture is that without pollinators, things are much more difficult. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations, wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. If you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. \n",
      "Wild bees are generally becoming rare in the Western world due to habitat destruction. This is AFAIK most severe in C Europe.  \n",
      "I agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide, but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse.  \n",
      "\"\"Little if anything\"\"? The proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with CCD. Even in the event that CCD should prove to be a \"\"disease\"\", diseases are rather specific in what they affect, and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects; and there are only 7 species of honey bees. It's like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals, such as humans. That is an unreasonable expectation - it most definitely does NOT \"\"stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder\"\" - the reality is exactly the opposite. The seven species in the genus Apis have had something on the order of 35 million years of independent evolution - 35 million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects; compare that to the 70 million years mammals have existed. The human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer, as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. But no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. Why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?\n",
      "While it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects, bees foremost among them, CCD, even in a worst-case scenario, is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture.  \n",

      "Wikipedia claims (or is promoted by its users as) a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia. They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute, let alone a replacement. What's more, because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia's philosophy, design, and operation, it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are many problems with Wikipedia, some more important than others. I'll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ignorant Edit-Bully\n",
      "Many people have noted this phenomenon, though I've never seen a good name for it before. In a nutshell, the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field (but not a regular Wikipedia contributor) notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field. They want to be a good citizen, so they edit the page and correct the error. However, within minutes, their correction has been reverted, restoring the error, and if they're particularly unlucky, they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change, accusing them of \"\"page vandalism\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site, watching for edits to pages that they've contributed to. Any change to \"\"their\"\" page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted, regardless of its merit. What's worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution. They would appear to typically be young people, perhaps in their first couple of years of college. They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult, coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack. In \"\"real life\"\" they would be harmless, as they wouldn't be able to stand up to others in a confrontation, but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive. \n",
      "\n",
      "So an expert makes a contribution, sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way, and the expert simply leaves, never to contribute to Wikipedia again. The quality of many of Wikipedia's articles clearly shows this phenomenon; reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action, graphically. \n",

      "No Editors Means No Sense of the Valuable\n",
      "Wikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors, which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian. However, egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work, as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world. As Theodore Sturgeon noted, \"\"ninety percent of everything is [crap]\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "This leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the \"\"edit bullies\"\" described above: \n",
      "\n",
      "They do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about. \n",
      "They are generally not well-read or broadly-educated, having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth. \n",
      "They tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them, so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world, versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such \n",

      "\n",
      "Many Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures, if they have sufficient details to even be called that. Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all. A number of months ago, I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s; he could be considered the most important business person of the decade. I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all. Note that I am not identifying him by name; this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized, in order to render that particular critique null. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, being a good naive contributor, I created the article. I noted who he was, why he was famous, a few of his most important accomplishments, and I properly notated the article as being a people-related article stub, hoping others would help flesh it out.

When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were being servile to the Slavs to the point of debasing themselves, as one who is utterly mendicant, whilst disfavoring the Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary.

      "Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance.

It is a somewhat inflammatory word.  To many (esp. conservatives), \"\"activist\"\" is an insult.  I think \"\"activist\"\" is a fair factual description of some of Sotomayor's activities at Princeton and (to a lesser extent) at Yale, but without the context that is present later in the article, the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out, and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be (i.e. sit-ins, protests, 60s-style \"\"activism,\"\" militancy, that sort of thing).  That's not what you mean by the word in this context, but the reader won't know that before reading the full article, which is getting pretty long.  Also, it's not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway.  There's a lot of stuff in the article that's arguably more important than these particular episodes in her life (especially at Yale, where any activism really was a very small part of the story of her time there).  What do you think?  If you really wanted to keep this in the lede, perhaps the wording could be changed, e.g. \"\"She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools\"\" or something like that.

      "Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a \"\"ten-string guitar\"\". No one refers to the baroque lute as \"\"the 24-string lute\"\", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. \"\"12-string guitar\"\" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular \"\"cult(ure)\"\" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term \"\"ten-string\"\" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.\"\n",

DYK has the opportunity to train editors early on and get articles off on the right foot ... instead, procedures and practices (there and at WIKICUP) encourage the churning out of deficient articles to gain perceived prizes.  And what happens to the \"\"interest factor\"\" is the same as what happens to prose and sourcing ... editors learn, indeed are encouraged by reviewers, to pad up their articles so that expansion/length is met, and there is often no regard for whether that padding is a) based on reliable sources, b) relevant to the article, or c) well written.  A similar thing happens when we demand interesting hooks ... that quickly becomes scandalously ridiculous tabloid style hooks, often with BLP issues or MEDRS issues of plain faulty hooks because non-reliable sources are used.  We have admins whose own DYK hooks are inaccurate, and are passed, based on blog sources. Recently. SO ... yes, interesting hooks might be one part of training new and experienced editors and encouraging responsible and policy-compliant editing, but there's a huge iceberg under that tip at DYK that is not being addressed because the few qualified reviewers who are active there cannot keep up with the volume, and we have several entrenched DYK regulars who either don't care about copyvio and reliable sources or simply and still after many years of editing do not even understand core policies.  There is a need to address the whole picture not just \"\"lame hooks\"\" and the whole picture cannot be corrected unless you work with the few clueful regulars there to deal with the several who lack clue, impose their will, and routinely place deficient articles on the mainpage.   DYK will never be eliminated (it probably should be because it is responsible for so much truly bad content that will never be cleaned up), so can we at least work to improve reviewing there ?  A slowdown in volume would help, along with an elimination of QPQ so that knowledgeable reviewers can assure our mainpage is being used responsibly.  But part of that is dealing with the experienced \"\"leaders\"\" at DYK who don't know and won't enforce policy and good editing practice ... work with the few who do.  (Talk) \"\n",

Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again. Excessively re-adding controversial content is considered edit warring, and you can be blocked for this (see WP:3RR). What you need to do in these situations, is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles, that isn't how wikipedia works. I'll also note, that because of our NPOV policy, I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus.

He found that most could be traced to free mixed-race families formed of descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia.[4] They migrated along with European American neighbors to frontier areas, where they found less restrictive racial conditions.

      "THE EARLY YEARS: 1975–1993: Perhaps you did NOT read the newspaper accounts cited in this page of the very first meeting between the original clubs in 1975? Four minutes into the match and the players began to brawl! Yup, no rivalry, that. The Toros moved to Ft. Lauderdale in 1977, so from 1975–83, it was always the same two teams playing. The original Rowdies lasted until 1993 and all of the subsequent Striker teams in that era had numerous NASL-era Strikers playing for them. That is part of what carried the rivalry on during those lean ASL/APSL years. The other cited references span the years right up to the two franchises that play under the names Rowdies and Strikers in the NASL of today. Many were published by the local media in the two markets, some were done by the MLS and some by the new NASL. Are these not varied and reliable enough for your tastes? Or are you suggesting that every single article on the rivalry topic over the past 38 years needs to be cited to prove a rivalry existed and continues to exist? \n",

It would be more accurate to say many of those blog citations are used only to verify final scores or attendance figures. Again are you suggesting that every np article on every match be unearthed to confirm the scores? Until the USSF sees fit to publish the recap of every sanctioned match in US history online, resources will remain a hodge-podge. Nearly all of the narrative of the page in question is supported by information published by reliable media outlets.

I don't think there's enough published material to write an article just about clairsentience and that it should just be a subsection of ESP or another page. 90% of the clairsentience article was laying the groundwork for a state of reality where clairsentience could be real. That's fine, but it had very little had to do with clairsentience itself. The content about altered states of reality, etc. should probably go in an altered states of reality article instead of this particular article. I didn't, however, redirect it.

Some salt and pepper or other seasoning is usually added and the mixture is then cooked. To make lighter, fluffier scrambled eggs, some milk, cream, soy milk or water is also added.Then, instead of being put of a heat-transferring equipment, it is fried lightly on a pan with seaweed.

While seaweed is used in Chinese cuisine and Chinese cuisine can be quite varied due to the vastness of China and the diaspora of ethnic Chinese all over the world, I have never heard of eggs cooked with seaweed in Chinese cuisine.  No doubt someone out there might cook their eggs with seaweed, but it's definitely not something common in Chinese cuisineyou find me a restaurant that serves the eggs cooked that way!  Indeed even in Japan where seaweed is used more commonly, eggs are still more likely to be cooked without seaweed, and then maybe you sprinkle some seaweed on top for garnish or seasoning after the eggs are finished (or for sushi, you may see the egg omelette tied with seaweed to a block of sushi rice).  So anyway, I'm not believing this unless you can point me to a relevant source.\n",

A guy can't give a heartfelt opinion around here anymore without getting slapped with 8 or 9 \"\"policy violations\"\" right off the bat. ps - I appreciate your restoring my edit. It really isn't hurting anyone.   \"\n",

      "Well from the offerings you have made on your wiki, blog and elsewhere, you would certainly be a gem of an editor here. Your comments on the 10 commandments to save world fisheries and your notion of a Pacific Islands Fisheries Management Index move in directions I think the Wikipedia articles should. It's true that Wikipedia is more anonymous and constrains, in that you cannot present original research, but must instead back up statements with verifiable sources. It is an encyclopedia, so the encyclopediac game must be played. But still, that doesn't have to be that constraining, and Wikipedia has many advantages. The demand to be encyclopediac can often help cut through bull shit and starkly clarify where new research is needed. Important current issues that cannot be adequately sourced can still be discussed in the talk pages, and strategies can be developed so they may eventually get appropriate external sources. Well structured articles will be here to stay. They can have modest starts, but if properly framed will lend themselves to incremental improvements over time. Your articles need not drop off the edge of the blogosphere or disappear into the limbo of deceased wikis. They will have far more traffic and outreach than blogs or personal wikis can ever have. The traffic should increase with time. And of course you can still personally invite collaborators. An article on Pacific Islands Fisheries could be set up as a start to your index project, and a very nice article it could be too. We could work it up to FA. I think \"\"commandments\"\" for sustainable fisheries is probably the single most important topic in the Fisheries and Fishing WikiProject, and I'm sure we could eventually get that humming nicely in attention grabbing but encyclopediac ways across a number of articles.   \"\n",

Gains have been fairly uniform across the entire range of black cognitive ability.[28] J. Philippe Rushton and Arthur R. Jensen have disputed Dickens's and Flynn's findings, calculating a mean gain for Blacks of zero to 3.44 IQ points, and questioned the exclusion of four independent tests that showed low or negative IQ gains.[33] However, in the very same 2006 study that was criticized by Rushton and Jensen, Flynn and Dickens give explicit reasons for why four tests were excluded. Rushton and Jensen include in test such as the AFQT which is not strictly an IQ tests and their inclusion of Herrnstein and Murray's AFQT data was criticized by Flynn and Dickens. Rushton and Jensen derive the figure of a 3.44 IQ point gain by adding data from four excludes tests to Table A1 while Flynn and Dickens' figure of a 5.5 IQ gain for black Americans was derived from Figure 3 in the study.[34]\"\"\n",

      "I am really puzzled by the confusion that remains here. First, people need to know that the term prophet is used in two ways by the LDS. In essence, any individual who is given revelation which is pertinent to the future is acting prophetically. Thus, any individual (in or out of the Church) might prophecy and thereby be referred to as a small-'p' prophet. However, some individuals are formally ordained (by laying on of hands) as Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. Thus, Brother Jones may be a Bishop, a High Priest, an Apostle, and a Prophet at the same time (we actually have 15 prophets if you wish to pursue the issue). Unique to the LDS belief is the understanding that the authority of Priesthood offices are retained, based on worthiness, forever. So while Joseph Smith acted prophetically, he also held the titles of, Elder, Apostle, Prophet, President, and High Priest. It could also be said he was a Deacon, a Teacher, and a Priest. These are titles. In fact, broken down by office and (common usage)\n",

I would imagine that, just as it would be a breach of separation of powers for someone to be simultaneously Congressman and President, it would be a breach of federalism for someone to simultaneously serve in two different governments. I have no idea why the seniority date isn't the actual date of oath-taking, but he couldn't have voted on federal legislation until he resigned as a city councilman and was sworn into Congress, so there was, in reality, no dual office-holding.   \"\n",

Also, if you have a chance, check out the recent addition to Valid Criteria under WP:PORNBIO, #6; it seems to say that if a porn actor is not notable as a porn actor, but is notable outside of porn, then he warrants a article as a porn actor  I think it's absurd.

The article, however, at least as I read it, also agrees with us. It asserts there are two types of indeterminacy, either or both of which can be marked by use of they. Where does it say one \"\"shifts\"\" into the other?\n",
      "Regarding your sentences, you have constructed them such that all have indeterminate gender. The first, however, could clearly apply to 0, 1 or >=2 people, so also has indeterminate number (or is plural, per Givón). The key thing is that all your sentences involve universal quantification over the domain (or restriction) of a variable: for all people or students x in X, your sentences assert something that is true for person or student x. Because there is a plurality of x in X, Givón and other liguists, call usage of they, in constructions such as yours, plural. Because each x is a singular person (in the first sentence a hypothetical person), ordinary people, like you and me, call this usage \"\"singular\"\". In fact, though, these constructions are distributive (one assertion to each of many people), which is why grammatical number cannot be well defined. There is no specific reference, so singularity or plurality can't be derived from a referent in the usual way. The constructions have either generic reference, or no reference at all.\n",

I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well-known leader.  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (if this is what \"\"racist\"\" means): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page.  But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well-written and reasonable, and therefore of interest.  As an experienced (non-American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches, and is the way to approach the truth, like any scientific research: it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect - we are all human - and I can understand that this might be the reason.\n",

It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word \"\"genocide\"\" instead of the word \"\"terrorism\"\". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link.

      "\n",
      "1. Linga as Arthabrahma or phenomenal manifestation\n",
      "\n",
      "Linga is the amorphous representation of Shiv and can be regarded as the highest emblem of Shiv because of its least anthrophomorphic nature. Shiv, Parabrahman, is the highest Divine Principle in intimate union with Divine Power, the Parashakti. The only positive qualities of this Divine Principle are Shat, Chit, and Anand. He is conscious of Himself i.e. He has Atmavimarsha. He is the cosmic Purusha (person) but is Nirakar - has no particular form and has no distinguishing mark. He is therefore inconceivable. \"\"God cannot be known by the mind or the physical senses\"\" is consensus of all the sages. It is in this sense Herbert Spensor speaks of God as \"\" Unknown and unknowable.\"\" What he means is that Deity per se is \"\"Unknown and Unknowable.\"\" John Fiasco further argues that \"\"Deity is unknowable to the extent of it is not being manifested to consciousness through the phenomenal world knowable but knowable in order of its phenomenal manifestations: knowable in a symbolic way as the power of being rhythmic life of the universe; knowable as eternal source of moral law.\"\" If we accept this, then Shiv is inconceivable. But if He is not conceived, how can he be worshipped? Yet religious mind craving for eternal happiness cannot be satisfied without worship and cannot do without worship. He, therefore, requires some kind of representation or symbol of God. Without some concrete symbol of God, God would be a formless abstraction devoid of meaning to him/her. Hence it for those, who cannot digest abstract ideas of God, temples are built and images representing Gods in different powers and attributes are consecrated. Whatever may be said against images in the temples, rituals, and ceremonies, the fact remains that they are indispensable at a certain stage of the spiritual evolution life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nirakar Shiv is Amurtha (formless) in his indistinct condition, and is Murtha or Sakar in his manifest condition –manifest in the form of universe. Shiv assumes eight-fold forms and is, therefore, called as Ashtamurthi. Then the Linga represents the whole universe appearing hemispherical placed on something. The Linga, the amorphous symbol of Shiv, thus, represents the Murtha form of Shiv. Hence, the Linga signifies Alinga or Shiv that has no special form or mark. The circular base with round semi-spherical top placed on it fits the description of the idea of Murthavthva.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Linga as Shabdabrahma\n",
      "\n",
      "Shivaparabrahman is the cosmic Purusha having Atmavimarsha. He first vibrates in his Leele (play or amusement) towards creation. The vibration is Nada (a loud roar), the first expression as Nama or name. From his Nada proceeds Bindu (dot), i.e. the form. The couplet Nama and Rupa or Nada and Bindu are known as Onkara or Pravana. The Bindu is the disc-like Peetha and Nada is the line that supervenes the Peetha. The line stands on the Bindu like a cylinder with a rounded top. All this forms the Linga.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Linga as the Visvarupa\n",
      "\n",
      "Shivaparabrahman has no particular form but is all-formed. He is, therefore, called Visvarupa. He is the creator of the Universe and assumes all forms in the Universe. He is hidden in all creatures, and pervades all and forms inner souls of all. He is said to have a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. He has hands and feet in all directions. The semi-spherical top that supervenes the circular base represents this description of cosmic Purusha, with whom His devotees identify Shiv. The round top on the circular base really consists of thousands of heads, each of the size of a point. The sides of the cylindrical figure represents equally thousands of heads, eyes, and faces in all directions. The semi-spherical top, resembling the visible horizon, is truly symbolical of the universe that surrounds the earth on all sides. Though the symbol has no eyes and feet, or eyes and ears, it has thousands of hands and feet, heads, eyes, and ears in all directions, just as a circle has no face all around but it has faces in all directions at every point of the circumference. Thus the Linga is the closest possible representation of such formless or all-formed God Shiv. \n",

      "It is customary in nature that all classes of things in universe must have different shapes and forms. The so-called \"\"Gods class\"\" must have different shapes and forms, though nobody knows what those shapes and forms should be.

I just saw this comment of Sept. 10, 2008, because someone or something placed it in an archive page (25) that did not exist last night or even early this morning.  I almost didn't see it at all.  Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.  I have no control over others' practices in choosing Wikipedia identities, and I am not aware of anything that I have done that violates WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, Wikipedia:Etiquette in my comments in either of the AN/I situations.  Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as \"\"NYScholar\"\" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.  Despite my requests for compassion and understanding because I have other important non-Wikipedia work to do (which have been in the \"\"N.B.\"\" above and were only edited out in the past two days in response to Shell's comments about the \"\"N.B.\"\" section), I was continually being forced by administrators and others to reply to them in what I increasingly regard as a dysfunctional AN/I based on both misunderstandings and violations of the AN/I instructions by the user who posted it and by the continual references to a previous AN/I by others, including administrators, extending it when it should have been expunged.\n",

He's temporarily blocked for this (initially permanent but gave him the benefit of the doubt) and I'm trying to see if this guy would pass notability guidelines. He's got an assertion to it and I can see where he's mentioned in places, but I don't see anything that's really in-depth. Most of it is mentions of website exclusives for his company, but there are some interviews with him in places that don't really seem to pass our RS guidelines. I've asked the comic WP to take a look, but I'm still really unsure of this guy's notability. I trust your opinion, so I thought I'd ask you to take a look.

As per rules on the host country places, these will only be granted in any of the nine places entrusted to the host nation, if it did not obtain any place in that event during the qualification period. With Rippel's victory at the Pan American Games, the host country still keeps a quota in the 50 m rifle prone.

It's also what I just stated above: \"\"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying.\"\" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that \"\"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship.\"\" I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated.

They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text.

I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you've done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that \"\"many other sources\"\" show the opposite of the material you kept removing. If there were many other sources of such nature, you'd be able to present one other than the Schwartz study, which is not an opposing study (as in a study directly going against what the studies in the article have found).

Also, the comments were conclusionary, they did not provide the reasoning.  For example, the LA Times quote stated that she is bad.  Whoa!  That's an elementary school argument.  There was no explanation on WHY JRB is so \"\"bad.\"\"  that is NOT a NPOV presentation.

      "It is true that geological studies show changes of the environment that contradicts the strong Gaia hypothesis of ecosystems working towards an optimum state. It is also true that there is evidence that ecosystems have collapsed from within. However, the frequency of such ecosystem collapses through geological history is many orders of magnitude lower than the extremely high frequency predicted by the Malthusian model of maximum reproduction. So evolution must be driven by something other than maximization of reproduction. The selfish gene model (the theoretical mechanism basis of the Medea hypothesis of life destroying itself) appears to be supported by simple computer simulations, but so does strong Gaia hypothesis. The strong Gaia hypothesis failed scale-up to more complex systems, and the missing frequency of Medean ecosystem collapses can be explained if the selfish gene model also fails scale-up to the greater complexity of real life because real life is too complex to be livable to such rigid, unselfcritical entities as the selfish gene model claims that living organisms are. In other words, the selfish gene model is based on the same methodological error as is the strong Gaia hypothesis. This is explained in greater detail on the pages \"\"Moderating the Gaia/Medea debate\"\" and \"\"Self-organization\"\" on Pure science Wiki, a wiki devoted to the scientific method unaffected by academic prestige obsession.\n",

Backstage segments aren't notable, and don't affect the matches or anything... why add this one over others? Just because it was a reunion isn't a good enough reason in my opinion. People certainly could argue the Boogey Man/Trump segment was notable, as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction (or just on the fact Trump appeared). It's fancruft and serves no purpose except that some people might think it's \"\"interesting\"\". That's not enough to keep it on the article.  \n",

It being a reunion and at WM does help its case IMO (especially the reunion part). You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem, so you wouldn't be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring? If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section, what would we put down for them so someone else doesn't remove it. It also got covered in most reviews and coverage of the event (coevering the notability part). Being cruft is an opinion; being a reunion featuring over a dozen legends and covered by almost every review makes it worth at least mentioning.  \n",

The matches are reviewed in the reviews as well: that doesn't mean we will start listing highlights for each match. I also recall there being a guideline on Wikipedia about it not being a democracy: meaning not everything should be determined by a vote. I somehow think if this fancruft was gone: no one would be re-adding except for TJ. From the edit history: it seems like he was the only one re-adding it back. That certainly shows that people don't care about it. A few talk page posts in favor of it: isn't much consensus to keep it on the article.  \n",

He was born in Britain, Fights for Britain, and has British citizenship. A user who has been responsible for a slow-moving edit war stated that Khan publicly identifies as British-Pakistani. However, if this is the case it will need a source, and if they can provide a reliable one I would be more than happy to see him described as British-Pakistani in the lead as personal identification is important.

No.  Are they worth mentioning?  Yes.  It's pretty notable that one of these events featured a threat to a person.  Bounties on private citizens don't go up every day.  This article is a lot like an ad, but I guess that's the intent of the most persistent Wikipedia editors. If it puts them in a positive light, it's totally relevant and notable.

You really do have to read WP rules very carefully such as WP:RS & WP:Verifiability. It says {[Quote|Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.[4] Reliable sources are necessary both to substantiate material within articles and to give credit to authors and publishers in order to avoid plagiarism and copyright violations. Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require high-quality sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is.\n",

      "Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.}} That's why we use Tamilnet as a QS not RS.

In addition, the application to the Magnetosphere is very different than the application to the solar corona, in that magnetospheric reconnection topologically requires a 4-flux system, whereas the solar corona requires only a 2-flux system.\n",

In the event they do return, they'll either continue disrupting the project (in which case it's easy enough to re-block) or will contribute helpfully (in which case we're better off than when we started); in the former case, the indefinitely blocked vandal will be quite able to return using another account, anyway, so the term \"\"indefinite\"\" can be a bit misleading.

Of course, it may also, unbeknownst to me, be the standard way of indexing Arabic names - I doubt it however, seeing that his sons were named Hussein, not Saddam, indicating that Hussein is indeed the name to index.

Take a look at #138  it isn't issued to Colt, it has nothing to do with guns, and it was issued in the wrong year. Then take a look at X9430: for a revolver, issued to S. Colt on Feb. 25, 1836.

Prior to 1837 (and the fire that destroyed the patent office's copies of those first patents) patents weren't numbered. After the fire, in 1837, the Patent Office started numbering all new patents, beginning at 1. They also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents, and numbering them as they found them, but beginning with X1. So pre-fire (1836 and earlier) patents are X-series, post-fire patents don't have the X. The patent Colt was issued in 1836 was an X-series patent, because it was issued before the fire. Anything without an 'X' can't be the right patent number for that date.\n",

      "As a Professor of Law at BYU from 1973-1996, his teaching and research focused on family law and education law, with particular interests in the legal rights of children and in the legal status of marriage.  A sample of his scholarly articles includes publications in the Harvard Law Review, Harvard International Law Journal, Michigan Law Review, Duke Law Journal, Ohio State Law Journal, and the American Bar Association Journal. Two of his articles were cited in opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has been an invited speaker at professional conferences on family, education, and constitutional law in a variety of international and domestic locations.\n",

      "In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. A portion of his remarks summarized “the secular case against same-gender marriage.” He cited the 2006 decision of the French parliament rejecting gay marriage so that children “do not suffer as a result of situations imposed on them by adults.  The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” \n",

      "The false prophet, the navi sheker, the \"\"madman\"\" Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: \"\"These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.\"\" \n",
      "Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as \"\"a prophet from the midst of thee.\"\" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. \n",
      "Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - \"\"altering\"\" the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this \"\"imitation\"\" and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: \"\"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.\"\" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.\"\" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. \n",
      "The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive \"\"from the midst of thee\"\" is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: \"\"I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God.\"\" As it says: \"\"Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.\"\" Deuteronomy 13:1. \n",
      "\"\"A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.\"\" Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known. The sentence quoted above was taken from a paragraph in Deuteronomy that specifically warns the Jewish people about the prohibitions of soothsaying, astrology, divination, sorcery, etc. The Gentiles believe they can manipulate and use these practices in ord\n",

Also Christian coalitions have core requirements like acceptance of the Divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, Holy Trinity, Ressurection and Salvation through grace, personal relation to J.C. etc. Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, etc, don't accept all of these.

      " - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.\n",
      "Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you \"\"I've never done anything like this before, either\"\". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   \n",

If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   \n",
      "\n",
      "It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation. (talk) \n",

      "Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant \"\"to knock, as on a door\"\" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like \"\"you're\"\" and \"\"your\"\", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier \"\"gay\"\", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex \"\"gay anal sex\"\", but that's really irrelevent. \n",

These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: \"\"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly\"\". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind.

      "\"== Article flagged - could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand. First,statistically, pit bulls are less agressive (naturally) than, beagles, german shepards and other breeds. Secondly, the dogs only want to please their owners, that is why if you watch the [disgusting] videos of dog fighting you will see 90% of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owner(s) encouraging them to fight. A perfect example is the Michael Vick case, his dogs were taken and put into kennels, as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the [high] profile of the case. Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down; which means that is only 12%. Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients. The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too \"\"Blame the Deed NOT the Breed\"\" which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs, just the one's that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting. Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature. If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls, I mean there was Petey (little rascals) and betty boop had a pitbull. Plus many other famous actors/actresses.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  \n",
      "\n",
      "The article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls, but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively. The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start, but is insufficient. I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission, but I'm adding a request in any case.   \n",
      "\n",
      " Why does the article need that? Any dog breed can attack.  There's nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks. The muzzle image is fine; it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public.  Talk \n",
      "\n",
      " A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article.  To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article...  Or a Jew in a concentration camp, or I suppose a photo of a mugging would compare to animal aggression, but those wouldn't be true to Human character would they?   \n",
      "\n",
      "Isn't a photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws? Some places, such as some public parks, require all dogs to be muzzled while attending, regardless of breed, so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations. As I wrote in my first post, for an article that discusses pit bull attacks, an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text. Wikipedia:Images: \"\"Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the article's topic.\"\" Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images: http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0108/485244.html and http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/02/mandatory-confi.html. Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons. I remember there used to be a photo of a \"\"smiling pit bull\"\" in the article (see archive Nov 1, 2007).

But language is not logical (it is one of the flaws in I/P articles that no attention is paid to this, despite academic literature on the issue), but full of queered exceptions, where tone and use subvert comparisons rooted in a sense of parity. For example, just the fact that in standard usage, -phile is suffixed to a disyllabic term for a country ('Anglo'/'Franco'/'Sino'/'Russo'), whereas Israelo-, having three syllables, differs and creates a slight jarring difference from the norm, counts. There's an informal rule that ethnic disyllable are neutral, a pejorative connotations elicit monosyllables ('spik, wog, yid, chink, gook, hun','nip'/'jap', 'frog' etc., though exceptions exist, 'Polack') and this plays round the other terms, to nuance them in various ways.

Assume that a person reading this has no idea what a Jak is, and has never heard about previous Jak games or the Jak universe. Look at each part and ask yourself if it is 100% clear that this particular section is about a fictional game that exists in relation to other games (not just in the intro). Remember that you are describing a work of fiction, not telling a story. Also the style is repetitive and boring. Let me pick apart a paragraph - \n",
      "\n",
      "The missions (what is meant by \"\"mission\"\"?) in Jak 3 are generally either platform-based(platforming) or driving-based. The platform segments involve Jak(\"\"the player\"\", Jak is a rendered model, someone else is doing the jumping. \"\"Jak\"\" is ok for story elements, but gameplay is about the player) jumping from platform to platform (that is what platforming means, right?) battling creatures along the way (he battles in both types of missions, right?). For these segments, he is also provided a rifle (does someone give him a rifle at the beginning of each segment?), the functionality of which changes with the kind of ammunition being used (how so?, also maybe \"\"changes depending on the ammunition used\"\"). The car driving (\"\"driving\"\", \"\"car\"\" is implied) segments (segmentsX2) usually involve Jak racing against time (prose, try \"\"have specific time constraints\"\") to complete a mission (that is what one does with missions), while defending himself against other cars (cars attack people?) or giant Metal Heads (?). When not on a mission (missionX3), Jak wanders the streets of either Spargus or Haven City (prose, and what reason do we have to care which fictional city he is wandering in?), searching for someone to assign him a mission (this sentence makes him sound so lame).\n",

And if you look at the talk page, my issue was with needing to add the creation time, I wasn't even thinking about Giano (had I known adding his name was such an issue, I would have left it off, had I known I was going to be accused of harassment, I would never have even thought of adding it). As for WP:V for making claims about people, I just find that seriously bizarre. You are saying Wikipedia logs are not reliable sources for what Wikipedia editors do? That's pretty ridiculous. The log information stating exactly that information is precisely what readers would have to have had to look at (if they knew how to do it) to even understand the article. Finally, as for not using self references, look at the article context. It was quite clearly nonsense not to refer to the fact that that article had only existed for a few hours. How can you not self reference in that situation? Or are you honestly saying that was not pertinent information, about a claim being made about an article having existed or not? The situation falls squarely between the radio host example and the Siegenthaler incident. Adding a self reference was the only way that paragraph could be written to make any sense.\n",

      "\":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real \"\"edit conflict\"\" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - \"\"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references.\"\" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of \"\"Welsh nationality\"\" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his \"\"explanation\"\" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about\n",

For instance, you see little merit in not taking him seriously. I too think sarcasm is sometimes an easy scapegoat, but the page isn't about my opinion or yours, it's about him and about the entirety of opinions available on him (e.g. something like \"\"supporters claim he was often misinterpreted through his sarcastic persona, yet critics think said persona is used as an excuse for ignorant statements\"\" could be helpful).

In this case, I'm sure I didn't respond particularly appropriately, but the whole thing is irritating.  It's particularly irritating to be informed of things by a bot.  And also irritating to get what are obviously public domain images deleted on the basis of this sourcing nonsense.  I haven't corrected it any further because PD Thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it, so I assume it will be deleted, so I'm not going to bother with fixing it, but really the whole thing is absurd.  I notice you say that the image's copyright status cannot be corroborated.  That is obvious nonsense.  PD Thor, the one who noticed its supposed \"\"unsourcedness\"\", managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the US government website and reupload it.  About two minutes of searching on the US Census website, I think, pretty much brings it up.  It is also identical to 49 or so other county maps present on wikipedia, most of which, I think, are sourced.  So, yeah, this is technically unsourced.  But a little common sense should tell anyone that it's obviously PD, and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself, rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it.  The whole way images are dealt with on Wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating.  At any rate, any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment.  I'm not interested in hearing from you about this subject, and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct.  I will strive, as always, to avoid personal attacks.  I am sure that, on occasion, my emotions will get the better of me and I will screw up.  If you are concerned about such further instances, feel free to report me to the proper authorities, or what not.  I will add that I don't see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here.  When I was promoted to administrator, at least, the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion.  Whether or not I sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities, I am fairly certain that I have never abused my authority as an administrator, which I almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves.  I don't think I have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page.  There was at least one incident where I was accused of protecting a page inappropriately, but I think that was at least arguably justified.  So I feel like I'm pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator, and try hard not to abuse that power.  The idea that I have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that I do not hold.  Best,   \"\n",

      "The case is very simple.  ‘Violation’ and ‘malfeasance’ involve here the claim of the infringement of Wikipedia guidelines by (two) administrators who, as such (i.e. as administrators), are charged instead with the safeguarding of those very guidelines.  Administrators, yourself included, do not, and cannot, play any role whatever within the Wikipedia scheme other than that of assuring that WP guidelines are implemented and not infringed by the users: there is no scope within the project, as it stands defined at present, for any other additional role that they might even potentially or hypothetically assume.  Even their efforts at protecting the site from vandalism, etc., are only within their purview as guardians of (published) house rules (which, in this case, define vandalism for example in ways differing from those understood by the general public) — nothing, nothing, not an iota more than that.  There is no mechanism here for ‘discretion’, ‘broad’ or otherwise, whereby they could obtain blanket license to violate those guidelines without accountability: the moment that such powers (to dispense with guidelines altogether) are vested in or arrogated by them, (1) they cease to be administrators and become ma-and-pa corner grocery’s owners, with the goods on the shelves their private property to dispose of as they see fit; and (2) Wikipedia ceases to be a community editing project and becomes the private fiefdom of a limited few.  So no, I do not believe you understand that you do not operate here in a vacuum of your own making: I am Wikipedia every bit as much as you are, thank you very much.\n",

The right to make generalized unsubstantiated allegations amounts to the license to launch personal attacks, a practice that again runs afoul of Wikipedia policies.  You are now violating those policies yourself.

There is no other remedy, as failure to clean the house would amount to allowing it to sink to the lowest common denominator determined by such administrators (and their unaccounted and perhaps unaccountable private reasons which propel them to certain actions).  Enthusiasm for the project and other such factors cannot be sufficient qualification to make someone an administrator here: a certain integrity, a sense of ethics, and a modicum of objectivity (the ability, that is, to see beyond the tip of one’s nose), are also required.  While the fulfilment of these requirements cannot obviously be easily determined beforehand, the discharge of one’s mission as an administrator can be appraised retroactively, and such appraisal should determine whether a user should continue in his/her supervisory capacity.  You wish to protect the administrators accused of wrongdoing now (by failing to answer the facts of the case as requested, but drawing instead all kinds of red herrings out of the hat), from the desire to m\n",

Russian offenders do not want do it (they are offenders - because they use materials, which banned by the government of Russia).  Read our legislation on this issue: Federal Law of 25 July 2002 N 114-FZ \"\"On Countering Extremist Activity. We ask read this article also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Internet_blacklist (useful thing to understand better). We ask take action already now. Nazi materials for attention of Russian citizens - is the big reason to close Wikipedia on all languages (in all Russia totally). Rules of any Wikipedia say: need to respect legislation of all jurisdictions (USA, Florida and all other countries in the same time). If you will say about: \"\"English Wikipedia has no any relation to other Wikipedias - biggest mistake (for the Russian government such argument is empty space): 200 Wikipedias can be banned till correction of mistakes (as result of ignoring).

As this all occurs in between the First English Civil War, which ended May of 1646, and the Second English Civil War. Naturally at the time 'His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration' was published there was no foresight that predicted the Second English Civil War, but it might be considered slightly inflammatory.
